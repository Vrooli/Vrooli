## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be configured to customize resource connections:

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `API_PORT` | API server port | Auto-assigned (15000-19999) | Yes (auto) |
| `UI_PORT` | UI server port | Auto-assigned (35000-39999) | Yes (auto) |
| `OLLAMA_URL` | Ollama API endpoint | `http://localhost:11434` | No |
| `QDRANT_URL` | Qdrant vector database endpoint | `http://localhost:6333` | No |
| `POSTGRES_*` | PostgreSQL connection parameters | Auto-configured by lifecycle | No |

**Note**: Port assignments are managed automatically by the Vrooli lifecycle system. Manual configuration is only needed for custom deployments.
