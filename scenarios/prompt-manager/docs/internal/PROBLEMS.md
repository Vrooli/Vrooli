## 2026-08-19 Architecture Audit Residuals

The proto re-platform plan owns API/CLI layout, transport, bindings, measures,
and contract documentation. The following audit findings are intentionally not
fixed by that plan and therefore have explicit owners.

| Finding | Evidence / impact | Owner | Exit condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| UI architecture audit debt | The 2026-08-19 server-owned architecture audit (`20260819-032525-cd984dc1`) reports broad UI structure/documentation findings outside the transport plan's boundary. | Prompt Manager UI maintainers; follow-up UI architecture plan | A focused UI audit has a stored baseline and clears required structure/documentation findings without folding UI redesign into the API migration. |
| Test coverage gaps in tags, agents, store, testing, search, and metrics | Package-level gaps listed below predate the migration and are not equivalent to transport parity. | Prompt Manager test-substrate plan | Each named package has behavior-focused unit coverage and the scenario test receipt records the new pass set. |
| Graph recent-activity signal remains neutral | `RecentActivityScoreFromTimestamp` exists but graph nodes do not carry the required timestamp. | Graph domain owner | Node contracts carry authoritative update time and graph scoring tests prove non-neutral recent activity. |
| Optional Qdrant degradation lacks a dedicated resilience SLO | Text fallback exists, but this plan does not define a resource-outage performance/recovery SLO. | AI Search domain owner | A resource-degraded test and measured recovery/latency target are documented and enforced. |

Runtime/manifest divergence, empty layout scaffolding, the orphan Graph RPC,
REST retirement, and missing stateful-domain measures were closed by phases
11–16 of the re-platform plan. The 2026-08-19 live evidence is 120 Connect
commands, 10 intentionally local commands, 75 typed omissions, 18 architecture
exceptions, nine probed measures, six remaining non-domain REST registrations,
and 117/117 callable Prompt Manager bindings in Program Runtime's doctor.

## Code Quality Debt

### API

| Area | Issue | Severity | Recommended Fix |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Error handling | Inconsistent error response format across domains | Medium | Standardize with shared error types |
| Validation | Input validation scattered in handlers | Low | Extract to middleware or shared validators |

### CLI

| Area | Issue | Severity | Recommended Fix |
|------|-------|----------|-----------------|
| Output formatting | Duplication across domain commands | Low | Consolidate into `internal/output` |

### UI

_No significant debt identified._

## Test Gaps

### API Coverage

| Package | Coverage | Gaps |
|---------|----------|------|
| skills/ | Good | handlers_test.go, query_test.go exist |
| heartbeat/ | Good | scheduler, executor, handlers, prompt builder, team execution queue, member context all covered |
| tags/ | None | Needs handler tests |
| agents/ | None | Needs handler tests |
| teams/ | Partial | Heartbeat cleanup + handler coverage exists; expand org chart + messaging tests |
| store/ | None | Needs relation and index tests |
| testing/ | None | Needs handler tests with mock Ollama |
| search/ | None | Needs handler tests |
| metrics/ | None | Needs repository tests |

### CLI Coverage

| Package | Coverage | Gaps |
|---------|----------|------|
| `cli/teams` | Targeted | Team policy flag resolution and preset transitions covered; broader command integration tests still needed |

### Recommended Test Priority

1. `api/skills/handlers_test.go` - Extend existing tests
2. `api/tags/handlers_test.go` - CRUD tests with mock repository
3. `api/search/handlers_test.go` - Search logic tests
4. CLI integration tests with mock API for end-to-end command output

## E2E Issues

| Area | Issue | Impact | Recommendation |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| UI smoke coverage | Smoke tests now cover load, scene switching, new-skill editor open, skill save/discard, and member creation | Low | Add BAS coverage for search filtering and one full team policy edit flow |
| Requirements linkage | BAS workflows not linked to requirements JSON | Low | Add automation validation entries once requirements are formalized |

### Missing data-testid attributes in production bundle (Fixed)
- **Execution ID:** ebf858ab-d3d0-4b9a-b2f6-6e4a11c11a87
- **Output path:** `/tmp/bas/prompt-manager/world-ui-loads`
- **Screenshot:** `/tmp/bas/prompt-manager/world-ui-loads/screenshots/step-02-wait-world-canvas.png`
- **Root cause:** prompt-manager UI was serving a stale production bundle built before data-testid attributes were added, so BAS selectors could not resolve.
- **Fix:** rebuilt the UI bundle (`pnpm run build`) and restarted the scenario to serve the updated `ui/dist`.
- **Status:** Fixed (validated by successful BAS runs: `7d145946-73b2-4562-9378-b6363a6dd499`, `d9baa7b8-a171-4cd8-a2ff-ff794b57ecfb`, `1cfc4bc0-869a-4d18-ba43-2afadb6c450e`)

## Stability Issues

_No open crash issues identified. Team editor org chart now guards against self-connections and missing manager labels; relationship panels handle empty states gracefully._

---

## Root Cause Analyses (Resolved)

### Heartbeat trigger crashes when config is missing

**Hypotheses**
1. Trigger handler skips config checks, leading to nil dereference inside executor.
2. Executor assumes heartbeat config exists because scheduling only happens for enabled configs.

**Test/Verification**
- Manual trigger without `heartbeat.json` returns `404` and does not panic.
- Unit test: `api/heartbeat/executor_test.go#TestExecutorExecuteFailsWhenConfigMissing`.

**Root Cause**
- `Executor.Execute` and `TriggerManual` assumed `GetHeartbeatConfig` never returns `nil`, causing unsafe dereferences.

**Fix**
- Guard against nil configs and return a not-found error before updating state.

**Prevention**
- Added explicit nil checks and regression tests.

---

### Scheduler ignores per-member profileKey

**Hypotheses**
1. Scheduler uses a hard-coded default profile key for all runs.
2. Profile key is only honored in manual trigger path.

**Test/Verification**
- Scheduler uses `profileKey` from config in `api/heartbeat/scheduler_test.go#TestSchedulerUsesConfigProfileKey`.

**Root Cause**
- Scheduler did not consult per-member heartbeat config when executing scheduled runs.

**Fix**
- Introduced a config-store seam in the scheduler and resolved profile key at execution time.

**Prevention**
- Added scheduler unit tests covering default and custom profile keys.

---

### Removing a team member leaves scheduled heartbeats and member data

**Hypotheses**
1. Member removal only deletes the relation file and does not clean related member files.
2. Scheduler has no lifecycle hook to unschedule per-member entries when membership changes.

**Test/Verification**
- Member removal now unschedules and deletes the member directory in `api/teams/handlers_cleanup_test.go#TestRemoveMemberCleansDataAndUnschedules`.

**Root Cause**
- Cleanup responsibilities were split across domains with no explicit boundary for member teardown.

**Fix**
- Added `FileTeamStore.DeleteMemberData` and a handler-level cleanup step to unschedule + remove member data.

**Prevention**
- Centralized cleanup logic and added regression test.

---

### Deleting a team leaves scheduled heartbeats active

**Hypotheses**
1. Team delete path does not inform the heartbeat scheduler.
2. Scheduler retains cron entries independently of file store deletion.

**Test/Verification**
- Team deletion now unschedules all member heartbeats in `api/teams/handlers_cleanup_test.go#TestDeleteTeamUnschedulesHeartbeats`.

**Root Cause**
- Team deletion flow skipped scheduler teardown and relied solely on file deletion.

**Fix**
- Unschedule all team heartbeats before deleting team files.

**Prevention**
- Added explicit scheduler cleanup and a regression test.

---

### Incomplete scenario registration in CLIDetector (Fixed)

**Root Cause**
- `NewCLIDetector([]string{"prompt-manager"})` only registered `vrooli` and `prompt-manager` as known CLIs. Scenario CLIs like `visited-tracker`, `app-monitor`, etc. were classified as `CodeExternalTool` instead of `CodeScenarioCLI`.

**Fix**
- Added `discoverScenarioNames()` in `main.go` that reads all scenario directory names at startup and passes them to `NewCLIDetector`. All 86+ scenario CLIs are now correctly classified.

**Prevention**
- Scenario names are discovered dynamically from the filesystem — no hardcoding required when scenarios are added or removed.

---

### Multi-line backtick commands missed by CLIDetector (Fixed)

**Root Cause**
- `Detect()` processed backtick patterns per-line, so multi-line backtick spans (with `\` continuation) were never matched.

**Fix**
- Backtick matching now runs on full content (after stripping code fences). Code fences are replaced with equivalent newlines to preserve line numbering.

**Prevention**
- Tests: `TestCLIDetector_MultiLineBacktick`, `TestCLIDetector_CodeFenceStripped`, `TestCLIDetector_CodeFencePreservesLineNumbers`.

---

## UX Issues

| Area | Issue | Impact | Recommendation |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| CLI | No completion support | Low | Add shell completion scripts |
| CLI | Long content truncated in list views | Low | Add pagination or --limit flag |

---

## Cleanup History

| Date | Change | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| 2025-01-25 | Aligned API with screaming architecture | All domains now have interfaces |
| 2025-01-25 | Added CLI domains for all API endpoints | Full CLI coverage |
| 2026-08-19 | Re-platformed Prompt Manager domains to generated proto/Connect bindings and retired their REST routes | 120 Connect commands; Program Runtime doctor reports 117/117 callable; measures-health probes all nine declared measures |

---

## Wiring Gaps

_No open wiring gaps._

---

## Deferred Work

| Item | Reason | Priority |
|------|--------|----------|
| Graph `recent-activity` scoring unwired | `RecentActivityScoreFromTimestamp` is implemented in [CODE: api/graph/scoring.go:RecentActivityScoreFromTimestamp] but `Node` lacks a timestamp field to feed it, so `recentActivityScore` returns a neutral 0.5. Wire it when nodes gain `updatedAt` metadata. | Medium |
| Qdrant integration | Optional feature, not core | Low |
| CLI shell completion | Nice-to-have | Low |
| Semantic search | Requires Qdrant | Low |

## Work ladder

- Rung: W0
- Evidence: goal `contribution-inbound-triage` directs a "new prompt-manager team that watches incoming submissions, decides disposition, and runs the rejection → typed evidence → plan-of-record learning loop"; no Prompt Manager P0 operational target names contribution triage or that learning loop. Goal `rapid-approval-flow` likewise directs agent recommendations, batch operations, keyboard shortcuts, and real-time updates, while no P0 target names those approval capabilities.
- Blocker: reconcile the active Prompt Manager goals with the P0 contract before treating lower-rung health evidence as proof that the whole intended product is complete.
- Measured: 2026-08-19
