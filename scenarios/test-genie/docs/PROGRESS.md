| Date | Author | Status Snapshot | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-11-30 | Codex Agent | Dependencies seam moved into Go | Reimplemented the dependencies phase in the API, added command lookup seam, and documented the seam inventory in docs/SEAMS.md. |
| 2025-12-01 | Generator Agent | Legacy scenario archived | Moved original implementation to scenarios/test-genie-old/ prior to v2 rewrite. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | React+Vite scaffold restored | Copied legacy docs, PRD, README into new scaffold to guide the rewrite stage. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Requirements re-seeded | Added OT-P0-001/002 and OT-P1-003 modules plus supporting documentation. |
| 2025-12-02 | Codex Agent | Scenario-local orchestrator online | Added bash orchestrator + rewritten phase scripts so OT-P0-001 no longer depends on scripts/scenarios/testing. |
| 2025-12-02 | Codex Agent | Suite request registry online | Added Postgres schema plus Go REST endpoints/tests for creating, listing, and fetching suite generation requests (OT-P0-002). |
| 2025-12-02 | Codex Agent | Go phase runners introduced | Added native structure phase + pluggable registry so the API can replace bash-based orchestrator logic incrementally. |
| 2025-12-03 | Codex Agent | Failure telemetry embedded in Go phases | Added failure classifications/observations to the suite orchestrator, aggregated dependency gap reporting, and documented the new failure topography. |
| 2025-12-03 | Codex Agent | Queue + execution signals wired into API | Added execution history endpoints, health telemetry, CLI surfacing, and per-phase summaries so operators can see backlog, last run, and failure context without scraping logs. |
| 2025-12-04 | Codex Agent | Business registry audited via Go phase | Ported the business requirements phase into the Go orchestrator, enforcing module metadata without jq and adding validation tracker coverage in Go tests. |
| 2025-12-04 | Codex Agent | Unit phase migrated to Go runner | Added go test + shell lint execution to the SuiteOrchestrator with command stubs + unit tests so the bash unit phase can eventually be retired. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Integration/perf runners ported | Implemented Go-native integration/performance phases with CLI+Bats validation, go build benchmarks, ordering fixes, and orchestration unit tests. |
| 2025-12-05 | Codex Agent | Testing config wired into Go orchestrator | Added .vrooli/testing.json parsing for phase toggles, presets, and timeouts with API tests plus requirements mapping so OT-P0-001 keeps improving. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Experience architecture surfaced | Replaced the placeholder UI with queue metrics, suite request forms, Go runner controls, and selectors so the scenario advertises the Go-based orchestrator flows again. |
| 2025-12-05 | Codex Agent | Experience flows audited | Added scenario focus controls, inline queue-to-run actions, and filtered tables so operators can move from queueing to execution without retyping scenario names. |
| 2025-12-05 | Codex Agent | Backlog/failure guidance shipped | Added flow highlight cards, scenario suggestion lists, and rerun shortcuts so operators immediately see which suite to run or rerun without scanning every table row. |
| 2025-12-05 | Codex Agent | Experience architecture audit | Added persona-based guide rails, anchor navigation, and new focus/rerun actions so new users can find queue/run controls without hunting. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Guided flows + Go preset reference | Added intent-based navigation, focus insights, and a Go preset coverage map so new and returning operators can follow the queue→run→investigate journey without deciphering bash-era assumptions. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Tabbed operations layout | Split the dashboard into Overview/Operate/Signals tabs, moving queue/run forms and telemetry into dedicated surfaces so personas can stay oriented instead of scrolling a single mega page. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Structure parity checks added | Ported the legacy structure-phase coverage into the Go runner with .vrooli/testing overrides, JSON validation, and regression tests so OT-P0-001 keeps moving away from bash-era helpers. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Requirements sync automated in Go | Added a Node-backed syncer that runs after successful full-suite executions, emits phase metadata, and keeps requirements/index.json in sync without the bash orchestrator. |
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Requirement tagging enforced | Added `[REQ:TESTGENIE-*]` tags across Go + Bats suites so OT-P0-001/002 tests register coverage and can sync requirements without the legacy scripts. |
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Execution service extracted | Centralized queue-status transitions, orchestrator calls, and persistence inside a Go service with unit tests so the API handler screams the queue→run→telemetry architecture again. |
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Lifecycle + Makefile aligned with standards | Added health endpoints, setup/develop show-urls, install-ui-deps naming, lifecycle conditions, and replaced the template Makefile with the canonical lifecycle-aware version so scenario-auditor stops flagging those structural gaps. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Experience audit improvements | Added scenario directory, inline guidance tips, toned-down copy, and hero intent cards so the dashboard explains the jobs-to-be-done and exposes every tracked scenario without jargon. |
