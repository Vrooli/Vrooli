| Date | Author | Status Snapshot | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Go API split into screaming packages | Refactored the API into `cmd/`, `internal/app`, `internal/suite`, and `internal/scenarios` packages so HTTP, orchestration, and catalog responsibilities are explicit, promoted shared domain types/errors for cross-package use, and backfilled tests/docs to keep behavior unchanged. |
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Workspace + phase plan surfaced | Split the Go orchestrator into explicit `ScenarioWorkspace` + `PhasePlan` types, added an API-accessible phase catalog, and wired `/api/v1/phases` so every surface can describe the Go-native testing architecture without diving into bash scripts. |
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Phase catalog screams suite intent | Added a first-class phase catalog/type system in the Go API so structure/dependencies/unit/etc. are modeled explicitly, presets derive from the same registry, and requirements syncing + tests can reason about optional phases without stringly-typed guesses. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Intent rail + quick focus | Added nav-level focus picker plus a global intent summary with queue/run/signal shortcuts so personas can execute the coverage journey without re-scanning the dashboard. |
| 2025-11-30 | Codex Agent | Dependencies seam moved into Go | Reimplemented the dependencies phase in the API, added command lookup seam, and documented the seam inventory in docs/SEAMS.md. |
| 2025-12-01 | Generator Agent | Legacy scenario archived | Moved original implementation to scenarios/test-genie-old/ prior to v2 rewrite. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | React+Vite scaffold restored | Copied legacy docs, PRD, README into new scaffold to guide the rewrite stage. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Requirements re-seeded | Added OT-P0-001/002 and OT-P1-003 modules plus supporting documentation. |
| 2025-12-02 | Codex Agent | Scenario-local orchestrator online | Added bash orchestrator + rewritten phase scripts so OT-P0-001 no longer depends on scripts/scenarios/testing. |
| 2025-12-02 | Codex Agent | Suite request registry online | Added Postgres schema plus Go REST endpoints/tests for creating, listing, and fetching suite generation requests (OT-P0-002). |
| 2025-12-02 | Codex Agent | Go phase runners introduced | Added native structure phase + pluggable registry so the API can replace bash-based orchestrator logic incrementally. |
| 2025-12-03 | Codex Agent | Failure telemetry embedded in Go phases | Added failure classifications/observations to the suite orchestrator, aggregated dependency gap reporting, and documented the new failure topography. |
| 2025-12-03 | Codex Agent | Queue + execution signals wired into API | Added execution history endpoints, health telemetry, CLI surfacing, and per-phase summaries so operators can see backlog, last run, and failure context without scraping logs. |
| 2025-12-04 | Codex Agent | Business registry audited via Go phase | Ported the business requirements phase into the Go orchestrator, enforcing module metadata without jq and adding validation tracker coverage in Go tests. |
| 2025-12-04 | Codex Agent | Unit phase migrated to Go runner | Added go test + shell lint execution to the SuiteOrchestrator with command stubs + unit tests so the bash unit phase can eventually be retired. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Integration/perf runners ported | Implemented Go-native integration/performance phases with CLI+Bats validation, go build benchmarks, ordering fixes, and orchestration unit tests. |
| 2025-12-05 | Codex Agent | Testing config wired into Go orchestrator | Added .vrooli/testing.json parsing for phase toggles, presets, and timeouts with API tests plus requirements mapping so OT-P0-001 keeps improving. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Experience architecture surfaced | Replaced the placeholder UI with queue metrics, suite request forms, Go runner controls, and selectors so the scenario advertises the Go-based orchestrator flows again. |
| 2025-12-05 | Codex Agent | Experience flows audited | Added scenario focus controls, inline queue-to-run actions, and filtered tables so operators can move from queueing to execution without retyping scenario names. |
| 2025-12-05 | Codex Agent | Backlog/failure guidance shipped | Added flow highlight cards, scenario suggestion lists, and rerun shortcuts so operators immediately see which suite to run or rerun without scanning every table row. |
| 2025-12-05 | Codex Agent | Experience architecture audit | Added persona-based guide rails, anchor navigation, and new focus/rerun actions so new users can find queue/run controls without hunting. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Guided flows + Go preset reference | Added intent-based navigation, focus insights, and a Go preset coverage map so new and returning operators can follow the queue→run→investigate journey without deciphering bash-era assumptions. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Tabbed operations layout | Split the dashboard into Overview/Operate/Signals tabs, moving queue/run forms and telemetry into dedicated surfaces so personas can stay oriented instead of scrolling a single mega page. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Structure parity checks added | Ported the legacy structure-phase coverage into the Go runner with .vrooli/testing overrides, JSON validation, and regression tests so OT-P0-001 keeps moving away from bash-era helpers. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Requirements sync automated in Go | Added a Node-backed syncer that runs after successful full-suite executions, emits phase metadata, and keeps requirements/index.json in sync without the bash orchestrator. |
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Requirement tagging enforced | Added `[REQ:TESTGENIE-*]` tags across Go + Bats suites so OT-P0-001/002 tests register coverage and can sync requirements without the legacy scripts. |
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Execution service extracted | Centralized queue-status transitions, orchestrator calls, and persistence inside a Go service with unit tests so the API handler screams the queue→run→telemetry architecture again. |
| 2025-12-06 | Codex Agent | Lifecycle + Makefile aligned with standards | Added health endpoints, setup/develop show-urls, install-ui-deps naming, lifecycle conditions, and replaced the template Makefile with the canonical lifecycle-aware version so scenario-auditor stops flagging those structural gaps. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Experience audit improvements | Added scenario directory, inline guidance tips, toned-down copy, and hero intent cards so the dashboard explains the jobs-to-be-done and exposes every tracked scenario without jargon. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Scenario catalog + status table | Added Postgres-backed scenario summaries, new API endpoints, UI status table, and per-scenario history drawer so operators can see every scenario’s queue + execution state and jump straight into the right action. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Catalog tab + signals nav | Split the catalog surfaces into their own tab with portfolio stats, directory cards, and the coverage table, plus a signals quick-nav to jump straight to queue or execution telemetry. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | Catalog hydrates all scenarios | Wired the API to `vrooli scenario list --json`, merged CLI metadata with queue telemetry, and removed the table cap so every scenario appears even before running tests. |
| 2025-12-01 | Codex Agent | ESLint flat config + catalog metadata | Added `eslint.config.js` for the UI workspace and exposed CLI metadata (status, description, tags) inside the catalog cards/table so operators can scan every scenario without leaving the dashboard. |
