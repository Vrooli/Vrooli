# Deployment Modes & Server Types

Use this to pick the right intent before generating desktop builds. Thin client is the only production-ready path today.

## Deployment Modes
| Mode | Purpose | When to use | Bundling | Requires Proxy URL |
|------|---------|-------------|----------|--------------------|
| `external-server` (Thin Client) | Desktop shell talks to the scenario already running on your Vrooli server | Default for every scenario today | No | Yes |
| `cloud-api` (stub) | Future: packaged cloud-friendly API generated by deployment-manager | Do not use yet | Planned | No |
| `bundled` (stub) | Future: fully offline bundle using runtime + manifest | Do not use yet | Yes | No |

## Server Types
| Server Type | What it does | Typical target | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------|
| `external` | Points UI/API to an existing server URL (LAN or Cloudflare) | Thin clients | Most stable; requires `server-url` and `api-url` |
| `static` | Ships only the built UI assets | Static-only scenarios | No API proxy; good for SPA utilities |
| `node` | Runs a bundled Node entrypoint | Node microservices | Experimental; ensure ports/env are baked in |
| `executable` | Spawns a packaged binary | Go/Rust/other binaries | Experimental; health/port checks required |

## Quick Decisions
- **Thin client?** `deployment_mode=external-server`, `server_type=external`, provide proxy URLs.
- **UI-only?** `server_type=static` with a built `ui/dist`.
- **Local embed experiments?** `server_type=node|executable` with clear ports and health checks.
- **Offline?** Not ready—use thin clients and follow the Tier 2 roadmap.
