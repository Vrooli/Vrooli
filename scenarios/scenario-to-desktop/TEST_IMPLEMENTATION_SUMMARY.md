# Test Implementation Summary - scenario-to-desktop

## Overview
Comprehensive automated test suite generated for the scenario-to-desktop scenario, following Vrooli's gold-standard testing patterns (visited-tracker).

## Test Coverage

Coverage needs a fresh run; the last snapshot is outdated. Re-run the suite to report current numbers.

## Summary

- API/CLI/UI/business/end-to-end suites exist and follow the visited-tracker patterns.
- Coverage targets are configured (warn at 80%, error at 50%); verify with a current report before quoting metrics.
- Tests exercise generation, build, packaging handlers, and integration seams; main/start remain integration-only.
