# Testing — Proto Health

How to write tests against this scenario's shape. Read this *before*
your first non-trivial test. `proto-health` is currently a generated
scaffold with the template `notes` reference still present; the real
test plan begins when `validation` and `protosurface` replace that
reference.

The shape is mature on purpose: every pattern below was already needed
in workspace-sandbox and got there by accumulating bugs. Starting here
means inheriting those lessons without repeating them.

## Shared guidance

- [Test authoring standard](/docs/testing/UNIT-TEST-AUTHORING.md): boundaries,
  fixtures, and independently justified expectations.
- [Execution and validation scope](/docs/TESTING.md): focused checks and Test Genie.
- [Shared harness recipes](/scenarios/template-manager/docs/internal/TESTING-RECIPES.md): API, UI, CLI,
  cancellation, workflow replay, and coverage configuration.

The recipes describe template mechanics. This guide owns local behavior, test
prerequisites, fixtures, and exceptions; local test sources and configuration
identify the helpers and gates this scenario currently uses.

## Scenario-specific testing

Existing local entry points (choose the domain test for the behavior you change):

- [api/handlers/health/handler_test.go](../../api/handlers/health/handler_test.go)
- [ui/src/App.test.tsx](../../ui/src/App.test.tsx)
- [ui/src/features/health/HealthCard.test.tsx](../../ui/src/features/health/HealthCard.test.tsx)
- [ui/src/layout/AppShell.a11y.test.tsx](../../ui/src/layout/AppShell.a11y.test.tsx)
- [cli/app_test.go](../../cli/app_test.go)

## TL;DR — the canonical examples

These files are the source of truth for the scaffold. When in doubt,
copy their shape:

- **API**: `api/handlers/health/handler_test.go` — table-driven, real
  middleware via `httpx.NewLiveServer`, fake pinger from `mocks/`,
  typed-proto decode via
  `assertx.MustUnmarshalProto[healthv1.Response]` (the wire shape lives
  in `packages/proto/schemas/proto-health/v1/health/health.proto`;
  assert on typed proto fields, not `map[string]any` chains). For
  endpoints whose wire shape isn't in proto yet, `MustDecodeJSON[T]`
  is the fallback — but adding the proto first is the right move.
- **UI composition**: `ui/src/App.test.tsx` — smoke-only composition
  test. App composes shell + features; feature behaviour belongs beside
  the feature.
- **UI feature**: `ui/src/features/health/HealthCard.test.tsx` —
  `renderWithProviders`, factory data, inline `vi.mock` factory
  closure, cimode assertions, and real-locale assertions.
- **UI a11y**: `ui/src/components/AppShell.a11y.test.tsx`,
  `ui/src/features/health/HealthCard.a11y.test.tsx`, and
  `ui/src/features/notes/NotesCard.a11y.test.tsx` — shell and feature
  accessibility are tested at their ownership boundary.
- **CLI**: `cli/app_test.go` — smoke gate (NewApp, --version, --help).
  When domain commands arrive, extend with `clitest.NewAPIServer` +
  `clitest.CaptureStdout` from `cli/internal/testutil/`.

If your test doesn't look like one of those patterns, ask why before
shipping.

## Proto-health target tests

The real `proto-health` domains add these test layers:

| Domain | Test | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| protosurface | descriptor reader fixtures | Prove `image.binpb` loading, source comments, service/RPC/message/field walking, imports, and deterministic ordering. |
| protosurface | scenario filtering fixtures | Prove one scenario's files are selected without walking or judging unrelated scenarios. |
| validation | finding-code table tests | One focused fixture per planned finding code and severity. |
| validation | manifest verifier fixtures | Temp repo fixtures cover clean manifests, stale input digests, edited outputs, orphan files, missing manifests, and advisory toolchain drift without invoking `buf`. |
| validation | boundary tests | Prove cross-scenario graph/dependency drift is not computed here. |
| CLI | manifest/binding tests | Prove `validate scenario` and `describe scenario` are declared with read/run_eligible governance and call the generated Connect methods. |
| UI | loading/error/empty/populated tests | Prove the inspection surface meets the direct-UI done obligation. |
| integration | test-genie phase tests | Fake CLI execution and assert findings map to `FINDING_SOURCE_PROTO`. |

`proto-health` tests should assert desired behavior, not current fleet
drift. Existing legacy annotations and hand-rolled transports are
fixture inputs; the expected result is the planned severity tier, not
"whatever the current repository happens to do."

## API testing

### CRUD reference — `notes` end-to-end

The `notes` domain is the canonical CRUD reference from the template.
For `proto-health`, keep it only until `validation` and `protosurface`
provide their own examples. New real code may copy its layering one
file at a time, but must rename the domain and delete notes once the
replacement is green. The pattern from wire to render:

| Layer | File | What it owns |
|---|---|---|
| Wire contract | `packages/proto/schemas/proto-health/v1/notes/notes.proto` | `Note`, `service NotesService`, `ListNotesResponse`, `CreateNoteRequest`, `CreateNoteResponse`, `GetNoteRequest`, `GetNoteResponse` |
| REST metadata contract | `packages/proto/schemas/proto-health/v1/notes/attachments.proto` | `Attachment` and `UploadAttachmentResponse` for the multipart upload exception |
| Connect error mapping | `internal/notes/service_error_mapping.go` | Typed sentinels become Connect codes (`invalid_argument`, `not_found`, `internal`) |
| REST error envelope | `packages/proto/schemas/proto-health/v1/shared/errors.proto` + `internal/httpx/errors.go::WriteError` | Typed body for REST exceptions, with canonical codes (`invalid_request`, `not_found`, `internal`) |
| Domain types | `internal/notes/types.go::{Note, Attachment, CreateInput, ErrInvalidNote, ErrNoteNotFound}` | Domain-pure (no proto imports); typed sentinels translate into Connect errors at the handler edge |
| Repository interface | `internal/notes/repository.go::Repository` | Persistence seam — `Create` / `Get` / `List` |
| Repository impl | `internal/notes/sqlite.go::NewSQLiteRepository` | sqlite-backed `Repository`; production wires it once in `main.go` |
| Schema | `internal/notes/schema.{sql,go}::Schema()` | Domain-owned table DDL embedded via `go:embed`; collected by `internal/modules/registry.go::AllSchemas()` and applied at boot via `apidb.EnsureSchemas` |
| Repository test | `internal/notes/sqlite_test.go` | Real handle via `db.NewSQLite(t)` + `apidb.EnsureSchemas(ctx, d, ...providers...)` over system + notes (the canonical compose pattern) |
| Service | `internal/notes/service.go::Service` (+ `NewService`) | Application layer: validation (`title` required after whitespace trim), default substitution (`defaultListLimit = 100` when caller passes 0). Handler depends on this, not the repository. |
| Service test | `internal/notes/service_test.go` | Substitutes `mocks.FakeRepository` (from co-located `internal/notes/mocks/`); pins the validation, default-substitution, and error-propagation contracts |
| Connect handler test | `handlers/notes/connect_handler_test.go` | Substitutes `mocks.FakeService` and exercises the generated Connect client/handler path |
| Multipart handler test | `handlers/notes/attachments_handler_test.go` | Uses `blobstore.MemoryBlobStore` plus test metadata repositories to exercise file-upload success and error paths |
| Mocks | `internal/notes/mocks/{repository,service}.go::{FakeRepository,FakeService}` | Co-located with the domain (Pass-3 pattern) — `FakeRepository` carries state for service tests; `FakeService` records inputs for handler tests. Both use atomic call counters + per-method error knobs. Deleting `internal/notes/` takes them along. |
| UI client | `ui/src/api/notes.ts` | `notesClient = createClient(NotesService, transport)` plus `uploadAttachment` for multipart metadata |
| UI tests | `ui/src/api/notes.test.ts` + component tests | Mock generated client methods and `uploadAttachment`; REST helper tests stub `global.fetch` |
| CLI client | `cli/domains/notes/{register,handlers,attach_handler}.go` | `Register(core)` returns a `cliapp.SubcommandGroup`; handlers use generated Connect clients or `cliapp.UploadFile` and render via cli-core reports |
| CLI test | `cli/domains/notes/handlers_test.go` | Spins a real `httptest.Server` via `testutil.NewAPIServer`, captures stdout via `testutil.CaptureStdout` |
