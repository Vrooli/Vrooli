  "content": "# Screaming Architecture Audit Methodology\n\n## Core Principle\nThe architecture should \"scream\" its purpose. Looking at the top-level directory structure should immediately tell you what the system does, not what framework it uses.\n\n## Audit Checklist\n\n### 1. Directory Structure Review\n- Top-level folders reflect domain concepts, not technical layers\n- Feature folders are cohesive and self-contained\n- Dependencies flow inward toward domain core\n- No framework-specific folders at the root level\n\n### 2. Naming Conventions\n- Files/folders use domain language, not framework terms\n- Component names reflect \"what\" not \"how\"\n- Avoid generic names like \"utils\", \"helpers\", \"common\"\n- Use ubiquitous language from the business domain\n\n### 3. Dependency Analysis\n- Domain layer has zero external dependencies\n- UI layer depends on domain, never vice versa\n- Infrastructure adapters are easily swappable\n- No circular dependencies between modules\n\n### 4. Questions to Answer\n- Can a new developer understand the system purpose in 60 seconds?\n- Are business rules isolated from delivery mechanisms?\n- Could you swap React for Vue without touching business logic?\n- Does the folder structure tell a story about the domain?\n\n## Red Flags\n- Folders named after frameworks (react/, angular/, express/)\n- Business logic in UI components\n- Domain models importing framework types\n- Circular dependencies between modules\n- Generic \"shared\" or \"common\" folders with mixed concerns\n- Technical layer folders at root (controllers/, services/, models/)\n\n## Recommendations Pattern\nWhen suggesting improvements:\n1. Identify the core domain concepts\n2. Propose folder structure that reflects those concepts\n3. Show how to move framework concerns to the edges\n4. Demonstrate dependency inversion where needed"
