Track development progress here. Each agent session should add an entry.

| Date | Author | Status Snapshot | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-11-28 | Generator Agent | Initialization complete | Scenario scaffold, PRD, requirements registry seeded. Ready for P0 implementation. |

Completeness: 12→12/100. Next: OpenRouter integration, streaming, multi-layer E2E validation. |
| 2025-11-28 | Improver Agent (Phase 1 Iteration 2) | Security & standards fixes | Fixed CORS wildcard vulnerability (HTTP-002); updated Makefile to match standards template; fixed service.json health endpoints; added 4 E2E playbooks for multi-layer validation; updated requirements with integration phase tests. Security: 1→0 vulnerabilities. Standards violations reduced from 75→50. |

| 2025-12-25 | Improver Agent | Test restructuring & P0 progress | Split monolithic main_test.go into 5 focused test files: inbox_test.go (312 LOC, 8 tests), chat_test.go (264 LOC, 10 tests), persistence_test.go (379 LOC, 14 tests), labels_test.go (457 LOC, 14 tests), openrouter_test.go (237 LOC, 8 tests). Added tests for /api/v1/models and /api/v1/chats/{id}/complete endpoints. Updated requirements to point to focused test files. Marked LABEL-005 and LABEL-006 as complete with API tests. Fixed database schema conflict by adding scenario-specific PostgreSQL schema (agent_inbox). Scenario now starts and API healthy (http://localhost:16661). Security: 0 vulnerabilities. Standards: 1 medium (Go workspace mode). Requirements coverage: 40%→44%. Next: Install openrouter resource, run integration tests, add NAME-* requirement tests. |
