#### Improvement Phase 9 (2025-10-18)
- **Progress**: Critical BATS test environment fix - restored 100% test pass rate
- **Problem Identified**: BATS tests were inheriting wrong `API_PORT` from ecosystem-manager
  - BATS setup was checking `if [ -z "$API_PORT" ]` before detection
  - Ecosystem-manager sets `API_PORT=17364` in environment
  - BATS would inherit 17364 instead of make-it-vegan's 18574
  - All CLI tests hitting wrong port → 404 errors → test failures
- **Root Cause**: Environment variable inheritance from parent scenario
  - When ecosystem-manager calls make-it-vegan tests, its env vars propagate
  - Conditional port detection `if [ -z "$API_PORT" ]` prevented override
  - Tests 4-8, 17-21, 24 failed (11 tests) due to wrong API endpoint
- **Solution Implemented**:
  - ✅ Changed BATS setup to ALWAYS detect make-it-vegan port
  - ✅ Removed conditional check - force port detection from `vrooli scenario status`
  - ✅ Added clear comment explaining why environment can't be trusted
  - ✅ Tests now reliably connect to correct scenario endpoint
- **Validation Results**:
  - Security: 0 vulnerabilities (unchanged) ✅
  - Standards: 5 violations (unchanged) - all acceptable patterns ✅
  - BATS tests: **34/34 passing (100%)** - RESTORED from 23/34 ✅
  - UI tests: 8/8 passing (100%) ✅
  - Make test: All lifecycle tests passing ✅
  - Health checks: Both API and UI healthy ✅
- **Impact**: Fixed 11 failing tests, restored full test suite reliability
- **Lesson Learned**: When running tests in multi-scenario environment, always detect ports explicitly - never trust inherited environment variables
- Tests passing: BATS suite ✅ (34/34), UI tests ✅ (8/8), lifecycle tests ✅, API health ✅, UI health ✅, all endpoints ✅

#### Improvement Phase 10 (2025-10-18)
- **Progress**: Code quality improvements with modular architecture and structured logging
- **Code Refactoring**:
  - ✅ Separated handlers into dedicated handlers.go file (351 lines → 93 lines in main.go)
  - ✅ Modular architecture: main.go now focuses on initialization and routing
  - ✅ All HTTP handlers organized in handlers.go for better maintainability
  - ✅ Improved code organization reduces cognitive load for future improvements
- **Structured Logging Implementation**:
  - ✅ Migrated from log.Printf to structured JSON logging with slog
  - ✅ Logs now include key-value pairs: service, action, port, error details
  - ✅ Better observability for debugging and monitoring in production
  - ✅ JSON format enables automated log parsing and analysis
  - ✅ Example: `{"time":"2025-10-18T19:20:03...","level":"INFO","msg":"Make It Vegan API starting","service":"make-it-vegan","action":"start","port":"18573"}`
- **Documentation Enhancements**:

  - BATS tests: 34/34 passing (100%) ✅
  - UI tests: 8/8 passing (100%) ✅
  - Make test: All lifecycle tests passing ✅
  - Health checks: Both API and UI healthy ✅
  - Binary size: Unchanged at ~8.5MB ✅
- **Code Quality Impact**:
  - Maintainability: Improved with modular handler organization
  - Observability: Enhanced with structured logging
  - Documentation: Better for future developers and auditors
- Tests passing: All suites ✅, no regressions ✅, structured logs verified ✅

     - Handler exists in handlers.go (line 283: `func healthCheck`)
     - Properly registered in main.go (line 63: `router.HandleFunc("/health", healthCheck)`)
  4. **MAKE_IT_VEGAN_API_URL env validation** (cli/make-it-vegan:30) - FALSE POSITIVE
     - Code handles with fallback logic and helpful error messages
     - Supports multiple detection methods (env, scenario status, explicit)
  5. **API_URL env validation** (cli/make-it-vegan:66) - FALSE POSITIVE
     - Variable is internally constructed from validated API_PORT
