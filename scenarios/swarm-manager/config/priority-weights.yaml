# Priority Weight Configuration
# These weights are used in the priority calculation formula:
# Priority = (Impact × Urgency × Success_Probability) / (Resource_Cost × Cooldown_Factor)

weights:
  impact: 1.0        # Weight for task impact (1-10 scale)
  urgency: 0.8       # Weight for urgency (critical=4, high=3, medium=2, low=1)
  success: 0.6       # Weight for success probability (0-1)
  cost: 0.5          # Weight for resource cost (minimal=1, moderate=2, heavy=3)

# Priority Thresholds
thresholds:
  critical: 1000     # Priority score above this is critical
  high: 500          # Priority score above this is high
  medium: 200        # Priority score above this is medium
  low: 100          # Priority score below this is low

# Cooldown Configuration
cooldown:
  base_hours: 24     # Base cooldown period in hours
  failure_multiplier: 2.0  # Multiply cooldown for each failure
  max_cooldown: 168  # Maximum cooldown in hours (1 week)

# Task Category Priorities (multipliers)
category_modifiers:
  critical-fix: 2.0      # System failures, security issues
  user-request: 1.5      # Explicit user requests
  system-health: 1.2     # Performance, optimization
  capability-growth: 1.0 # New features, scenarios
  knowledge-building: 0.8 # Documentation, testing

# Learning Rate
learning:
  success_weight_increase: 0.1  # Increase weight after success
  failure_weight_decrease: 0.05 # Decrease weight after failure
  adjustment_interval: 10       # Adjust after N tasks
