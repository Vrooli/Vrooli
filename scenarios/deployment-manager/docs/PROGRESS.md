|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-11-21 | Generator Agent | Initialization complete | Scenario scaffold from react-vite template, PRD with 99 operational targets (37 P0, 36 P1, 26 P2), requirements registry with 14 modules, .vrooli configuration (service.json + endpoints.json), RESEARCH.md (uniqueness + integration analysis), README.md, dependencies configured (postgres required, redis optional, scenario-dependency-analyzer/secrets-manager/app-issue-tracker critical). Ready for P0 implementation starting with Module 01 (Dependency Analysis). |
| 2025-11-21 | Improver Agent | Configuration & schema fixes | Fixed requirements index.json schema (flattened 37 P0 requirements from modular structure), created postgres schema.sql (9 tables: deployment_profiles, profile_versions, fitness_rules, swap_alternatives, deployments, deployment_health, audit_logs with triggers), created seed.sql (10 swap alternatives + 15 baseline fitness rules), fixed lifecycle configuration (added health endpoints, setup conditions, production bundle support with server.cjs, file_exists conditions), fixed Makefile (start target, test delegates to vrooli). Reduced auditor violations from 79→65. Ready for P0 Module 01 implementation (Dependency Analysis API integration). |
| 2025-11-21 | Improver Agent | Build & lifecycle fixes | Built Go API binary (7.6M), populated postgres schema successfully (7 tables created: deployment_profiles, profile_versions, fitness_rules, swap_alternatives, deployments, deployment_health, audit_logs), fixed show-urls.sh script paths in service.json (replaced non-existent script with inline echo commands), added clsx dependency to UI package.json. Security scan: 0 vulnerabilities, 65 standards violations remain. API process starts successfully. UI build blocked by pnpm workspace hoisting issue - needs resolution. |
| 2025-11-21 | Claude Code | Standards compliance fixes | Fixed Makefile structure (header changed to "Deployment Manager Scenario Makefile", removed CYAN color, updated help target with proper format, standardized usage entries), fixed service.json setup condition (added empty checks array), fixed PRD.md P2 section header. Reduced auditor violations from 66→62. Test suite ran with 4 phase failures (structure/unit/business/performance) but framework is operational. API binary exists at correct path. Ready for P0 implementation work. |
| 2025-11-21 | Claude Code (Improver) | Test infrastructure & iframe bridge | Created comprehensive Go unit tests (main_test.go) with sqlmock covering requireEnv, resolveDatabaseURL, health endpoint, logging middleware, route setup - achieving 49.3% code coverage with all 7 test cases passing. Fixed UI iframe bridge initialization by adding appId parameter ("deployment-manager"). Installed UI dependencies using pnpm --ignore-workspace to resolve @vrooli/iframe-bridge missing error. Built UI production bundle successfully (246KB gzipped). Reduced auditor violations from 57→55. Test results: 4/6 phases passing (structure, dependencies, integration pass; unit partially passes with Go ✅, UI config issues; business fails on unimplemented endpoints; performance fails on bundle checks). Workspace packages now correctly detected. Ready for P0 API endpoint implementation. |
