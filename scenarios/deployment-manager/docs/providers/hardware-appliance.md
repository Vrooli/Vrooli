# Provider Notes · Hardware Appliance (Future)

> **Status:** Vision document. Use this stub while planning Tier 5 deployments and hardware partnerships.

The hardware appliance line represents fully self-contained Vrooli servers for households and enterprises. Until hardware prototypes exist, capture requirements here so deployment-manager and manufacturing efforts stay aligned.

## Planning Checklist

1. **Reference Builds**
   - Define small/medium/large SKUs (CPU, RAM, storage, GPU options, power budget).
   - Map each SKU to the tiers/scenario bundles it can support.

2. **Provisioning Flow**
   - Decide whether appliances ship with Vrooli pre-installed or boot from a provisioning USB/ISO generated by deployment-manager.
   - Document first-boot experience (user accounts, secrets initialization, Cloudflare tunnel pairing, optional offline mode).

3. **Lifecycle Management**
   - OTA update strategy (signed images, rollback, telemetry opt-in/out).
   - Remote support hooks with privacy controls.

4. **Compliance & Security**
   - Hardware security modules, disk encryption, tamper detection.
   - Procedures for secure disposal or re-provisioning.

5. **Integration Points**
   - Tie into Tier 5 roadmap (`docs/deployment/tiers/tier-5-enterprise.md`).
   - Coordinate with secrets-manager for appliance-specific secret rotations.

As hardware experiments progress, expand this doc with concrete BOMs, manufacturing notes, and deployment-manager module requirements.
