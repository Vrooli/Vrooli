# UI Architecture

## Purpose Of This Document

Describe the canonical layout of the `ui/` source tree for scenarios generated
from the `react-vite` template, and the **slot taxonomy** that lets external
tools (notably `react-component-library`'s adoption resolver) place components
without asking the user for a path.

## Source Layout

```
ui/src/
├── api/            # api-client slot — Connect-RPC wrappers
├── app/            # app-bootstrap — Providers composition and route table
├── components/     # shared-component slot — cross-cutting components
│   └── ui/         # ui-primitive slot — headless primitives (kebab-case files)
├── consts/         # consts slot — strings + selectors registries
├── features/       # feature slot — per-feature folders (one subfolder per feature)
│   └── <feature>/  # feature-component slot — components inside a feature
├── hooks/          # hook slot — reusable React hooks
├── i18n/           # i18n bootstrap
│   └── locales/    # i18n-strings slot — one JSON per locale
├── layout/         # layout-shell + layout-nav slots — AppShell, Sidebar, TopBar, BottomNav
├── lib/            # lib-util slot — framework-agnostic utilities
├── pages/          # page slot — routed pages mounted under <Outlet />
├── test-utils/     # test-util slot — render helpers, factories, a11y
└── theme/          # theme-token slot — ThemeProvider + tokens.css
```

## Product Feature Layout (planned)

The slot taxonomy above is the invariant template contract. For this
scenario, the `feature` slot (`ui/src/features/<feature>/`) is the home
of the backup-manager product UI. The intended feature folders, all
WCAG AA with the platform default design tokens (status conveyed by
label/icon as well as color), are:

| Feature folder | Surface role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `ui/src/features/destinations/` | Destinations list with **usage versus cap** as the visual centerpiece. | Calm, status-forward; red reserved for genuine over-cap/failure. Shows encryption-on and separate-root state. |
| `ui/src/features/plans/` | Plan management — bindings of targets to destinations, schedule, retention. | Surfaces next-run and membership. |
| `ui/src/features/runs/` | Run history with per-target status and last-success-per-target. | "Next run", "within cap", "last verified" framing. |
| `ui/src/features/restores/` | Guided restore and verify flow. | Verify mode is the gate before removing data from git. |
| `ui/src/features/targets/` | Catalog view of self-registered targets. | Registration is primarily a programmatic/CLI surface; this is read-mostly. |
| `ui/src/features/health/` | Readiness and overdue/failed-backup posture (template-provided `HealthCard`). | Health and storage state are the operational dashboard. |

Each feature folder owns its components, its typed Connect-RPC client
under `ui/src/api/<feature>.ts`, its i18n strings, and (for the
stateful restore/verify flow) a `flow/` subdirectory per
[`FLOWS.md`](FLOWS.md). These features are designed, not yet built.

## Slots Are A Contract

Every directory above maps to a named slot in `ui/manifest.json`. The manifest
declares the directory **and** a default path pattern (e.g.
`{dir}/{ComponentName}.tsx`), so external tools can compute the canonical
filesystem path for a new file given just the component's name and slot.

A component library that publishes `"slot": "layout-nav"` and ships
`SidebarShell` knows — without any per-scenario configuration — that the file
should land at `ui/src/layout/SidebarShell.tsx`. Override the slot's `dir` in
a scenario-level overlay if you've reorganized; the resolver will pick up the
new path automatically.

## Adoption Resolver Flow

1. Library declares the component's slot (e.g. `"slot": "layout-nav"`).
2. Resolver looks up the slot in this scenario's UI manifest (this file's JSON
   sibling).
3. Resolver substitutes path-pattern tokens (`{dir}`, `{ComponentName}`,
   `{kebab-name}`, `{camelName}`, `{feature}`, `{locale}`) and returns the path.
4. Scenarios with no manifest fall through to a heuristic (scan for the slot's
   expected dir name) and then a final fallback
   (`ui/src/components/<ComponentName>.tsx`). Both flag warnings on the
   resulting adoption record.

## Extending The Manifest

- **Add a slot.** Add an entry to `ui/manifest.json`. Keep its `dir` inside
  `ui/src/` and pick a pattern that matches your file-naming convention. The
  schema (`scenario-ui-manifest/v1`) does not enum-restrict slot names — open
  set on purpose.
- **Override a slot in a single scenario.** Drop a partial manifest at
  `.vrooli/ui-manifest.json` in the scenario root; the resolver will read it
  as an overlay over the template manifest. (Overlay support tracked in
  scenarios/react-component-library's PRD.)
- **Add a `postApply` action** (auto barrel-export, route-register,
  i18n-merge). Reserved for a future schema bump (`scenario-ui-manifest/v2`).
  Document the intent in the consuming scenario's PRD until then.
