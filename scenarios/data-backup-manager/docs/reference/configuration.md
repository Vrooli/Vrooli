# Configuration — Data Backup Manager

How this scenario is configured — env vars consumed by the binaries,
the `.vrooli/service.json` manifest, and the per-user CLI config file.

The lifecycle (`vrooli scenario start`, `make start`) sets every
required variable automatically. You only need this reference when
running a binary by hand or when a scenario adds a new variable.

## Environment variables

### Required at runtime (set by the lifecycle)

| Variable | Range / format | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `API_PORT` | `15000-19999` | Port for the Go API server |
| `UI_PORT` | `20000-24999` | Port for the production UI server (`ui/server.js`) |

If the scenario adds WebSocket channels on the existing API or UI server, do
not add another `ports` entry. Declare an additional port only when the
scenario starts a separate listener process.

The canonical bands all sit below 32768 so Linux never hands out the
ports as outbound source ports. See the project-level
[port-allocation reference](../../../../docs/reference/port-allocation.md)
for the full policy.

### Optional overrides

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SQLITE_PATH` | `${SCENARIO_DATA_DIR}/data-backup-manager.db` | Override SQLite file location. The default routes through `api-core/storage` and resolves to a writable per-scenario data directory. |
| `API_TOKEN` | unset | Shared bearer token for CLI ↔ API auth (only enforce in production deployments). |
| `UI_BASE_URL` | (resolved by `@vrooli/api-base`) | External UI URL when the scenario is iframe-embedded. |

The browser UI does not read `API_PORT` directly. It resolves API calls through
the UI origin, and `ui/server.js` proxies `/api/*` plus the scenario's Connect
RPC namespace to the API process using the lifecycle-provided `API_PORT`.

### Scenario-prefixed CLI variables

`cli-core` derives a standard set of env vars from the scenario name.
For `data-backup-manager` the prefix is the scenario id upper-cased with
hyphens replaced by underscores (so `my-scenario` → `MY_SCENARIO`).
The following are recognised, in precedence order (first-found wins);
substitute your scenario's prefix for `<PREFIX>`:

| Purpose | Variables |
|---|---|
| API base URL | `<PREFIX>_API_BASE`, `<PREFIX>_API_URL`, `VROOLI_API_BASE` |
| API port | `<PREFIX>_API_PORT` |
| API token | `<PREFIX>_API_TOKEN`, `VROOLI_API_TOKEN` |
| Config dir | `<PREFIX>_CONFIG_DIR`, `VROOLI_CLI_CONFIG_DIR` |
| HTTP timeout | `<PREFIX>_HTTP_TIMEOUT`, `VROOLI_HTTP_TIMEOUT` |

> **Do not** set the un-prefixed `API_PORT` for a CLI invocation —
> when CLIs run inside web-console terminals it leaks across scenarios.
> Use the scenario-prefixed form or the `--api-base` flag.

## Service manifest (`.vrooli/service.json`)

Single source of truth for everything the lifecycle needs to know.

| Section | Owns |
|---|---|
| `service` | name, display name, description, version, category, maintainers, repository URL |
| `ports` | port-name → env-var + range mapping (lifecycle allocates from these) |
| `cli` | command name, install scripts (per OS), invoke shape, freshness inputs |
| `lifecycle.health` | `/health` endpoint, startup grace period, periodic checks |
| `lifecycle.setup` | build steps + idempotency conditions (binary present, UI bundle fresh) |
| `lifecycle.develop` | how to start the running scenario |
| `lifecycle.test` | which test command to invoke |
| `lifecycle.stop` | how to shut down cleanly |
| `environment` | static env vars set for every lifecycle step |
| `dependencies.resources` | shared local resources (kopia, vault, postgres, redis, qdrant, minio) |

The template ships with `dependencies.resources: {}`, but this scenario
is **not** standalone. Its locked design declares:

| Resource | Required? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `kopia` | yes | The wrapped backup engine — one kopia repository per destination; all snapshot/restore/verify/stats/retention go through `resource-kopia`. |
| `vault` | yes | Source of every destination passphrase and source/access secret; encryption-on-by-default depends on it. Fail closed if unavailable — never run unencrypted. |
| `postgres` | conditional | `pg_dump` for Postgres-kind targets. |
| `redis` | conditional | Prefix `SCAN`+`DUMP` for Redis-kind targets (best-effort). |
| `qdrant` | conditional | Snapshot API for Qdrant-kind targets. |
| `minio` | conditional | S3/MinIO source mirrors and S3-backed destinations. |

The conditional resources are needed only when a target of that source
kind (or an S3 destination) is in use. See
[`../concepts/INTEGRATIONS.md`](../concepts/INTEGRATIONS.md) for the
dependency contracts. Backup artifacts live in kopia repositories, not
in this scenario's SQLite catalog or source tree.

### Secrets

Repository passphrases and S3 access keys are held by the `vault`
resource and referenced — never copied — by the catalog. They are never
read from `.vrooli/service.json`, env files, or process argv. The
`kopia` resource sources them from vault at call time (passphrase via
the `KOPIA_PASSWORD` env var into the engine, per the kopia resource
plan).

## Schema bootstrap

Schema is owned per-domain. `api/internal/<dom>/schema.sql` declares
each domain's tables and is embedded into the binary via `go:embed`
from `api/internal/<dom>/schema.go::Schema()`. Cross-cutting
infrastructure (postgres extensions, custom types, cross-domain views)
lives in `api/internal/database/system.sql` — empty by default in
SQLite scenarios.

The shared registry at `api/internal/modules/registry.go::AllSchemas()`
collects them in order (system first, then domains alphabetical), and
`apidb.EnsureSchemas(ctx, db, modules.AllSchemas()...)` from
`api-core/database` applies them at startup. The path is idempotent —
all DDL uses `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` / `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN
IF NOT EXISTS`, so re-runs on every boot are no-ops.

Adding a column lands in the same diff as the Go struct field, the
repository scan, and the proto wire shape — single location, single
edit. Drops/renames in production data need the brownfield
versioned-migration helpers (`Migrate` / `MigrationProvider` in
`api-core/database`, deferred until the first scenario hits the pain).

For this scenario each product domain (`targets`, `destinations`,
`plans`, `runs`, `restores`) owns its own `schema.sql`; the catalog is
greenfield with no migrations folder. The `sources` and `health`
domains hold no durable tables. See
[`../concepts/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../concepts/ARCHITECTURE.md#domain-owned-schema)
for the design rationale and [`../internal/SEAMS.md`](../internal/SEAMS.md)
for the per-seam table (including the kopia and vault seams once wired).

## CLI config file

The scenario CLI persists per-user configuration to a JSON file.
Resolution order (first match wins):

1. `${<PREFIX>_CONFIG_DIR}/config.json` (the scenario-prefixed env var; see "Scenario-prefixed CLI variables" above)
2. `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/vrooli/data-backup-manager/config.json`
3. `~/.vrooli/config/data-backup-manager/config.json`
4. `~/.config/vrooli/data-backup-manager/config.json`

File shape:

```json
{
  "api_base": "http://localhost:15001/api/v1",
  "token": "optional-auth-token"
}
```

Set values via the CLI rather than editing the file directly:

```bash
data-backup-manager configure api_base http://localhost:15001/api/v1
data-backup-manager configure token <token>
```

## API-base resolution precedence

When the CLI calls the API, the base URL is resolved in this order
(first match wins):

1. `--api-base <url>` flag
2. Scenario-prefixed env vars (above)
3. CLI config file (`api_base` field)
4. Vrooli lifecycle port detection (`vrooli scenario port data-backup-manager API_PORT`)
5. Compile-time default (only set if explicitly configured in `app.go`)

If none of these resolve, the command exits with an actionable error
("API not available — try `--auto-start` or `vrooli scenario start
data-backup-manager`").

## Test/CI configuration

| File | Owns |
|---|---|
| `.vrooli/testing.json` | Test categories — lint, unit, business checks (endpoints, CLI commands), Lighthouse, bundle size |
| `.vrooli/lighthouse.json` | Lighthouse pages, thresholds, Chrome flags |
| `.vrooli/endpoints.json` | API endpoint manifest (path, method, status codes, request/response shapes, CLI mapping) |
| `.github/workflows/test.yml` | CI gate — UI lint + test, Go vet + race + coverage, E2E binary smoke |

These files are read by tooling (`vrooli scenario test`, `test-genie`,
the doc viewer) — keep them in sync with the code they describe.
