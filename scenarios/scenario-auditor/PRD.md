# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🎯 Capability Definition

### Core Capability
**What permanent capability does this scenario add to Vrooli?**
The Scenario Auditor adds the permanent capability to **comprehensively enforce quality standards across all scenarios**. It provides unified auditing of API security, configuration compliance, UI testing practices, and development standards. This creates a self-improving quality system where every scenario maintains consistent, high-quality patterns that compound across the entire ecosystem.

### Intelligence Amplification
**How does this capability make future agents smarter?**
- **Standards Repository**: Builds permanent knowledge base of quality patterns that prevent regression
- **Automated Compliance**: New scenarios inherit established best practices automatically
- **Quality Feedback Loop**: Violations discovered in one scenario prevent similar issues across all others
- **AI-Powered Rules**: Machine learning creates new quality rules from emerging patterns
- **Cross-Scenario Learning**: Standards violations become opportunities for ecosystem-wide improvements

### Recursive Value
**What new scenarios become possible after this exists?**
- **Automated Onboarding**: New scenarios automatically validated against all quality standards
- **Quality Gates**: CI/CD pipelines that prevent substandard code from entering the ecosystem
- **Maintenance Orchestrator**: Automated quality maintenance across all scenarios
- **Standards Evolution**: Dynamic quality standards that improve based on ecosystem feedback
- **Quality Metrics**: Comprehensive quality scoring and improvement tracking

- **API Health Check**: Comprehensive dependency validation including database, filesystem, and optional services
- **Lifecycle Integration**: Both API and UI properly managed through service.json develop lifecycle
- **Connection Validation**: UI health endpoint validates `/api/v1/health` is accessible

#### Health Endpoint Schema
```json
{
  "status": "healthy" | "degraded",
  "service": "scenario-auditor-ui",
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "uptime": 123.45,
  "checks": {

## 📝 Implementation History

### 2025-10-05: UI-API Connection Enhancement
**Issue**: UI health endpoint didn't verify API connectivity, making it difficult to diagnose connection issues.

**Changes**:
- ✅ Enhanced UI health endpoint to test API connectivity before reporting status
- ✅ Added comprehensive checks object to health response
- ✅ Implemented degraded status (503) when API is unreachable
- ✅ Added 3-second timeout for API health checks
- ✅ Documented proper lifecycle startup procedure in PROBLEMS.md

**Impact**:
- Connection issues now immediately visible in health status
- Easier debugging of UI-API integration problems
- Better monitoring and alerting capabilities
- Clearer operational status for lifecycle system

**Validation**:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:36224/health | jq '.checks.api'

# Should return:
# {
#   "status": "healthy",
#   "reachable": true,
#   "url": "http://localhost:18507/api/v1"
# }
```
