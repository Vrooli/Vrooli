# Scenario Auditor

> Comprehensive standards enforcement system for Vrooli scenarios

The Scenario Auditor is Vrooli's permanent quality gatekeeper, ensuring every scenario maintains consistent, high-quality patterns that compound across the entire ecosystem. It provides unified auditing of API security, configuration compliance, UI testing practices, and development standards.

## ✨ Features

### 🛡️ Comprehensive Standards Enforcement
- **API Standards**: Go best practices, security patterns, documentation requirements
- **Configuration Standards**: service.json schema compliance, lifecycle completeness  
- **UI Standards**: Browserless testing practices, accessibility, performance
- **Testing Standards**: Phase-based structure, coverage requirements, integration patterns

### 🔧 Rule Engine
- **Modular YAML Rules**: Easy to read, write, and maintain
- **Toggleable Preferences**: Enable/disable rules with persistent storage
- **Category Organization**: Rules grouped by api, config, ui, testing
- **AI-Powered Creation**: Generate and edit rules using natural language

### 📊 Quality Dashboard
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live standards compliance tracking
- **Violation Analysis**: Detailed breakdown by category and severity
- **Quality Scoring**: 0-100 score based on violations and importance
- **Trend Analysis**: Historical compliance data and improvements

### 🤖 AI Integration
- **Automated Fixes**: Claude Code agent spawning for violation fixes
- **Rule Creation**: Create new rules from natural language descriptions via `/api/v1/rules/create`
- **Rule Editing**: AI-assisted modification of existing rules via `/api/v1/rules/ai/edit/{ruleId}`
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Smart categorization and prioritization

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- Node.js 18+ (for UI)
- Git
- curl, jq (for testing)

### Installation
```bash
# Full setup
make setup

# Or step by step
make install  # Install dependencies
make build    # Build binaries
make install-cli  # Install CLI globally
```

### Usage
```bash
# Start the auditor
make run

# Access the dashboard
open http://localhost:35001

# Use the CLI
scenario-auditor scan current
scenario-auditor rules --category config
scenario-auditor fix ecosystem-manager --auto
scenario-auditor audit browser-automation-studio --limit 10 --min-severity high
```

## 📋 CLI Commands

The CLI is a lightweight wrapper around the scenario-auditor API. Make sure the scenario is running before using CLI commands:

```bash
# Start the scenario first
vrooli scenario start scenario-auditor

# Then use CLI commands
scenario-auditor scan [scenario] [--rule <rule_id>] [--wait] [--timeout <s>]
scenario-auditor rules               # List available rules
scenario-auditor health              # Check API health
scenario-auditor version             # Show version
scenario-auditor help                # Show help
```

**Note**: The CLI now uses async job-based scanning. Scans run in the background and the CLI polls for completion. Large scenarios may take 20-30 seconds to scan completely.

`scenario-auditor audit` defaults to summary output optimized for agent loops: once the security + standards scans finish, the CLI prints severity counts, the top N violations (default 20), and the artifact path for each scan. Use `--limit <n>` to change how many entries appear, `--min-severity <critical|high|...>` to filter noise, `--json` to emit the summary payload for downstream tooling, and `--all` to fall back to the legacy raw JSON stream. Pass `--download-artifacts <dir>` if you want the CLI to save the referenced artifact files locally.

### Summary API & Artifacts

- `GET /api/v1/scenarios/scan/jobs/{id}/summary` and `GET /api/v1/standards/check/jobs/{id}/summary` expose the same actionable payload that the CLI renders (total counts, severity distribution, rule aggregates, top violations, recommended steps). Query parameters:
  - `limit=<n>` – cap the `top_violations` array (default 20, max buffered 200)
  - `min_severity=<critical|high|medium|low|info>` – filter noisy entries when thousands of low-level warnings exist
  - `group_by=rule` – include an aggregated `groups` array keyed by rule_id for quick remediation planning
- `GET /api/v1/standards/violations/summary?scenario=<name>` returns the cached summary for the latest standards scan of a scenario (or the fleet-wide `all` bucket when omitted). It accepts the same filtering parameters so dashboards like app-monitor can present prioritized results without rerunning a scan.
- `GET /api/v1/scenarios/scan/jobs/{id}/artifact` (and `/standards/.../artifact`) streams the archived JSON blob persisted under `logs/scenario-auditor/<type>/<scenario>/…`. Artifacts stay on disk for 14 days and the CLI’s `--download-artifacts <dir>` flag simply mirrors these endpoints locally.
- Consumers that still need the full payload can combine the artifact endpoint with `scenario-auditor audit --all`; everyone else should rely on the lightweight summary for faster feedback loops.

### Port Detection

The CLI automatically detects the correct API port using this precedence:

1. `SCENARIO_AUDITOR_API_PORT` environment variable (scenario-specific)
2. Auto-detection from running `scenario-auditor-api` process (most reliable)
3. `API_PORT` environment variable (only if in valid range 15000-19999)
4. Default port `18507`

This ensures the CLI works correctly even when multiple scenarios are running with different port assignments.

### Examples
```bash
# Scan current scenario
scenario-auditor scan

# Target a specific rule and wait for completion (recommended for fixes)
scenario-auditor scan ecosystem-manager --rule iframe_bridge_quality --wait --timeout 600

# Run a full scan only if you need the complete violation list
scenario-auditor scan ecosystem-manager

# List available rules
scenario-auditor rules

# Check API health
scenario-auditor health

# Show version
scenario-auditor version

# List a scenario's violations after the scan job completes
scenario-auditor rules --category ui | grep iframe_bridge_quality

```

### Targeted Rule Validation

The CLI supports targeted validations so agents (or humans) can re-check a single rule without triggering the entire standards catalog:

- Use `--rule <rule_id>` (repeatable) or `--rules <id1,id2>` to restrict the scan.
- Combine with `--wait` to stream job status and `--timeout <seconds>` (default 600) to bound execution time.
- Prefer targeted scans when closing issues; fall back to a full scan only when you need the global violation list.

Example:

```bash
# Re-run a targeted scan and surface the resulting job details
scenario-auditor scan agent-dashboard --rule service_json_ports --wait --timeout 600
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

## 📊 Standards Categories

### service.json Validation
- ✅ Schema compliance with project-level schema
- ✅ Lifecycle completeness (setup, develop, test, stop)
- ✅ Binary naming conventions (`<scenario>-api`, `<scenario>`)
- ✅ Health check configuration (API + UI endpoints)
- ✅ Required step ordering and presence
- ✅ Develop lifecycle includes start-api/start-ui/show-urls conventions
- ✅ Ports configuration enforces API_PORT 15000-19999 and UI_PORT 35000-39999 ranges
- ✅ Test lifecycle uses the Go orchestrator via test-genie (`vrooli scenario test <scenario>`)
- ✅ Setup steps cover install-cli, scenario-specific build-api, and show-urls finale
- ✅ Setup conditions ensure binaries and CLI checks match the scenario name
- ✅ Lifecycle.health config enforces /health endpoints and http checks

### UI Testing Best Practices
- ✅ Unique element IDs for reliable testing
- ✅ data-testid attributes for interactive elements
- ✅ Semantic HTML for accessibility
- ✅ Loading state indicators
- ✅ Error handling display
- ✅ Consistent naming conventions

### Iframe Bridge Integration
- Add `@vrooli/iframe-bridge` to the UI package dependencies (workspace builds can use `workspace:*`, published scenarios should pin a semver range).
- In the UI entry file, import `initIframeBridgeChild` from the shared package, guard with `window.parent !== window`, and initialize it with an `appId` so orchestration can identify the UI.
- Scenarios that previously vendored `iframeBridgeChild.ts` should remove the copy and rely on the shared package instead.

### Phase-Based Testing
- ✅ test/phases/ directory structure
- ✅ Unit, integration, business, dependencies tests
- ✅ Performance and structure validation
- ✅ Test artifacts organization
- ✅ Executable test scripts

### API Security & Standards
- ✅ Secure tunnel proxy enforces proxyToApi usage for tunnel deployments
- ✅ Go module configuration
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Error handling patterns
- ✅ Structured logging
- ✅ Graceful shutdown
- ✅ Environment variable usage

```

### Adding New Rules
1. Create YAML rule definition in appropriate category folder
2. Include name, description, condition, and fix information
3. Test rule against sample scenarios
4. Document rule purpose and usage

Runtime signature: Go-based rules must expose an exported `Check` function with the shape `func (r *RuleStruct) Check(content string, filepath string, scenario string) ([]Violation, error)`. The `scenario` argument contains the scenario name during repository scans (and is empty for playground/unit tests), allowing rules to tailor messaging or behaviour per scenario while remaining deterministic.

### Rule Definition Format
```yaml
- id: config-service-json-exists
  name: "Service JSON File Exists"
  description: "Ensures that .vrooli/service.json file exists"
  category: config
  severity: critical
  enabled: true
  condition:
    type: file_exists
    target: ".vrooli/service.json"
  message: "Missing required .vrooli/service.json file"
  fix:
    type: file_create
    action: create
    target: ".vrooli/service.json"
    template: "service-json-template"
    description: "Create service.json from template"
  tags:
    - service-json
    - configuration
    - required
```

### Embedded Rule Tests
- Use `<test-case ...>` blocks inside Go rule files to describe sample inputs.
- Provide `path="relative/file.ext"` when a rule depends on filename or location (e.g., `.vrooli/service.json`, `api/main.go`). The test runner passes this path to the rule exactly as it would appear during a real scan.
- Optional attributes:
  - `scenario="name"` supplies the third argument to `Check`, letting rules verify scenario-specific logic.
  - `id`, `should-fail`, and `path`/`file`/`filepath`, plus the existing `<input>`, `<expected-violations>`, and `<expected-message>` sections remain supported.
