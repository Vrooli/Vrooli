# Meta-Optimization Manager

Measures local-coding-agent readiness by aggregating Answer/Validate/Guide coverage across the fleet and surfacing where to focus.

This scenario was generated from the `react-vite` template and packages
the standard full-stack Vrooli scenario shape:

- Go API (`api/`)
- React + TypeScript + Vite UI (`ui/`)
- CLI wrapper (`cli/`)
- Lifecycle + health wiring (`.vrooli/service.json`)
- Requirements registry + progress log (`requirements/`, `docs/internal/PROGRESS.md`)

> **Start here:** open [`docs/START-HERE.md`](docs/START-HERE.md). It
> owns the first-session initialization protocol — charter, requirements,
> domain map, design language, placeholder replacement, and first real
> vertical slice. Run `make orient` for a machine-readable gate status.

## What's In This Scenario

- Go API (`api/`), Go CLI (`cli/`), and React/Vite UI (`ui/`)
  coordinated through generated proto contracts.
- Lifecycle metadata, Makefile entrypoints, health checks, endpoint
  metadata, testing config, and CLI install wiring.
- Domain-first API shape with per-domain service, repository, schema,
  handler module, mocks, and tests.
- SQLite by default. Add external resources to `.vrooli/service.json`
  only when this scenario actually needs them.
- UI/CLI guardrails for i18n, accessibility, API base resolution,
  declarative command args, generated Connect clients, and report-shaped
  output.
- Baseline PWA branding metadata: web app manifest, standalone-mode
  mobile tags, and generic placeholder icons ready for scenario-specific
  replacement.
- Root-level `DESIGN.md` plus generated UI token assets from the
  selected design kit.
- A documentation contract in `docs/manifest.json`, with stubs for
  domains, flows, data, integrations, monetization, deployment,
  runbooks, observability, security, performance, and durable
  decisions.

## Placeholders vs. Durable Scaffolding

The generated scaffold is intentionally not the product. When you build
the real UX, treat these as **placeholders** to replace:

- The `notes` domain (proto, API, CLI, UI feature) — a worked vertical
  slice meant to be copied once and then deleted.
- The `AppShell` and the centered single-panel home page in `ui/src/`.
- The bare-minimum settings surface (currently just locale switching).

Treat these as **durable seams** to preserve, even as you rewrite the
visual layout:

- i18n wiring (`SUPPORTED_LOCALES`, `useTranslation`, `setLocale`).
- Accessibility primitives (`role`, `aria-*`, `data-testid` selectors).
- Design tokens (`bg-app-background`, `rounded-panel`, etc.).
- The feature-folder pattern under `ui/src/features/<name>/`.
- The proto → API → CLI → UI vertical-slice shape.

**Connect-RPC is the default transport.** Every domain endpoint goes
through a proto service and generated Connect handlers/clients. If
you find yourself writing `Path: "/api/v1/..."` as a literal string in
an `EndpointDescriptor`, stop — use a proto service method instead.
Codegen rejects literal Paths that lack an explicit `RESTException`
tag; the four allowed REST reasons (multipart upload, webhook
receiver, third-party shape, ops probe) are enumerated in
`api/internal/module/module.go`. The notes attachments endpoint is
the worked REST example.

[`docs/START-HERE.md`](docs/START-HERE.md) describes the replacement
workflow in full.

## Running The Scenario

```bash
# Build API + UI, install pnpm deps, install scenario CLI
make setup   # wraps `vrooli scenario setup`

# Start API + UI in the background
make start   # wraps `vrooli scenario start`
```

See [`docs/QUICKSTART.md`](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for the full clone-to-running flow.

Run tests with `make test` (which runs `vrooli scenario test`) or invoke
`test-genie execute meta-optimization-manager --preset comprehensive` directly for
finer-grained presets.

## Working Rules

1. **Read [`docs/START-HERE.md`](docs/START-HERE.md) first.** It owns the first implementation workflow.
2. **Run `make orient`** as a progress check — it reports initialization gates from `.vrooli/orientation.json`.
3. **Update `PRD.md` and `requirements/`** before feature work. Operational targets drive code + tests.
4. **Read root `DESIGN.md` before UI work.** Tokens, motion, and status semantics are binding; specific component lists in the design are illustrative — implement everything your scenario actually needs.
5. **Update `docs/concepts/DOMAINS.md`** before adding product code.
6. **Keep `docs/manifest.json` accurate.** Durable docs should be registered there with a truthful maturity value.
7. **Append progress entries** to `docs/internal/PROGRESS.md` whenever you land work.
8. **Add resources** to `.vrooli/service.json` only when needed; this scenario ships with no resource dependencies (SQLite is in-process).
9. **Keep boundaries**: only edit within this scenario's directory.

## pnpm Everywhere

This scenario assumes pnpm. If you run another package manager, convert
lockfiles yourself before committing. Scripts use `pnpm` directly (no
`npm` fallbacks) to reduce drift.
