  - id: BAS-AI-GENERATION-SMOKE
    category: ai
    prd_ref: "Functional Requirements > Must Have > AI workflow generation"
    title: AI generator produces executable smoke workflows
    description: |
      Captures deterministic prompts that must compile and execute through the planner without
      manual intervention.
    status: complete
    criticality: P0
    validation:
      - type: automation
        ref: test/playbooks/ai/generated-smoke.json
        phase: integration
        status: implemented
        notes: BAS workflow executing AI-generated flows end-to-end (pending export).

  - id: BAS-AI-GENERATION-VALIDATION
    category: ai
    prd_ref: "Functional Requirements > Must Have > AI workflow generation"
    title: AI prompts normalise and validate compilation plans
    description: |
      Ensures prompt normalization, compiler validation, and error reporting guardrails exist before
      triggering executions.
    status: complete
    criticality: P0
    validation:
      - type: automation
        ref: test/playbooks/ai/generated-smoke.json
        phase: integration
        status: implemented
        notes: Workflow will assert AI outputs and compiler validation once implemented.
