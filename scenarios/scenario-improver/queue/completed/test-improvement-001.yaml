title: "Improve error handling in scenario-generator-v1"
description: |
  Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic to the scenario 
  generator to make it more resilient to temporary failures.
  
  Focus on:
  - API timeout handling
  - File I/O error recovery
  - Memory cleanup on failures
  - Graceful degradation

type: improvement
target: scenario-generator-v1
priority: high

priority_estimates:
  impact: 8              # High impact on reliability
  urgency: high          # Important for stability
  success_prob: 0.85     # High confidence 
  resource_cost: moderate # Reasonable effort required

requirements:
  - "Add try-catch blocks around critical operations"
  - "Implement exponential backoff for retries"
  - "Add proper logging for error tracking"
  - "Must maintain backward compatibility"

validation_criteria:
  - "Error handling tests pass"
  - "Integration tests show improved resilience"
  - "Performance impact is minimal (<5%)"
  - "Documentation is updated"
