|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Initialization complete | Scaffolded scenario, PRD, and requirements modules for VPS-first cloud packager |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Manifest validation + planning stub | Added manifest schema/validation + `/api/v1/manifest/validate` and `/api/v1/plan` endpoints, CLI commands, and a small UI to validate/plan from JSON. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Test suite green + standards clean | Fixed `.vrooli` schema issues, Makefile/CLI standards violations, UI typecheck, and API health dependency shape; `vrooli scenario test` + `ui-smoke` now pass. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Mini-Vrooli bundling (P0-002) in progress | Implemented deterministic tarball builder + `/api/v1/bundle/build` + CLI/UI wiring and unit tests; updated requirements modules for manifest/bundling/integration refs/status. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | VPS preflight (OT-P0-003) in progress | Added `/api/v1/preflight` with DNS/SSH/OS/disk/RAM/ports/network checks, unit tests, and a `scenario-to-cloud preflight` CLI command; aligned requirement refs and reduced business warnings. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Bundling determinism hardened | Made bundle filename deterministic (sha-based), fixed deterministic ordering for embedded extra files, embedded `.vrooli/cloud/bundle-metadata.json`, and generated `.vrooli/service.json` to only enable required resources. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | VPS install/setup primitives (OT-P0-004) started | Added SSH/SCP-based VPS setup plan + apply primitives (mkdir, scp bundle, extract, run `./scripts/manage.sh setup --yes yes`, write scoped autoheal config, verify vrooli CLI) with API/CLI wiring and unit tests. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | VPS deploy/start primitives (OT-P0-005) started | Added VPS deploy plan + apply endpoints to provision Caddy, start analyzer-derived resources, start dependency scenarios, start target scenario with fixed ports (3000/3001/3002), and verify `/health` locally + via HTTPS; added CLI commands, unit tests, and playbook placeholders. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Inspect/log retrieval primitives (OT-P0-006) started | Added VPS inspect plan + apply endpoints to fetch remote `vrooli scenario status --json`, `vrooli resource status --json`, and bounded `vrooli scenario logs` output over SSH; wired CLI commands and tests. |
| 2025-12-16 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Mini-bundle go.work trimmed | Bundle now embeds a generated `go.work` that only includes `go.mod` modules present in the mini bundle, avoiding references to stripped scenarios/resources. |
| 2025-12-16 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | VPS primitives rebuilt + lifecycle fixed | Implemented missing preflight/setup/deploy/inspect APIs + unit tests, added playbook placeholders, fixed CLI command implementations, and updated CLI install to build with `GOWORK=off` so `vrooli scenario start` and `ui-smoke` work. |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Seam discovery & enforcement | Added `SecretsFetcher` interface to `secrets_client.go` and `SecretsGeneratorFunc` interface to `secrets_generator.go` to enable testing without live services. Updated `docs/SEAMS.md` with comprehensive testability seams documentation including SSH/SCP, DNS resolution, secrets fetching, secrets generation, and progress tracking interfaces. Verified build and existing tests pass. |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Server-level DI for seams | Promoted seams from inline instantiation to proper dependency injection via the Server struct. Added `sshRunner`, `scpRunner`, `secretsFetcher`, `secretsGenerator` fields to Server. Updated `handlers_deployment.go` to use injected seams instead of creating instances inline. Extended `RunVPSDeployWithProgress` to accept `SecretsGeneratorFunc` parameter. Updated `docs/SEAMS.md` with testing patterns. Build compiles; existing test suite runs (4 pre-existing failures unrelated to seam changes). |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Complete seam migration | Completed handler seam migration: (1) Migrated `handlers_edge.go` to use `s.dnsResolver` instead of inline `NetResolver{}`; (2) Fixed bug in `vps_deploy.go:325` where `secretsGen()` was incorrectly called as function instead of using interface method `secretsGen.GenerateSecrets(...)`; (3) Updated `docs/SEAMS.md` to document complete handler migration status. All handlers now use Server-injected seams for SSH, SCP, DNS, and secrets operations. Build compiles; 4 pre-existing test failures remain (fixture issues, not related to seam work). |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Add reusable test fakes | Created `api/test_fakes.go` with production-quality test fakes for all seams: `FakeResolver`, `FakeSSHRunner`, `FakeSCPRunner`, `FakeSecretsFetcher`, `FakeSecretsGenerator`. All fakes include thread-safe call recording, configurable error injection, and compile-time interface verification. Updated `docs/SEAMS.md` with documentation of test fakes and future seam opportunities (local command execution, analyzer client). Build compiles successfully. |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Cognitive load reduction | Reduced cognitive load in codebase: (1) Extracted duplicate SSH command runner into `RunSSHWithOutput()` in `vps_runners.go`; (2) Consolidated `RunVPSDeploy` to call `RunVPSDeployWithProgress` with no-op progress tracker, eliminating ~90 lines of duplication; (3) Added `ProgressBroadcaster` interface; (4) Created `FetchDeploymentContext()` helper in `http_helpers.go` to consolidate repeated deployment fetch/parse/validate pattern used in 22+ handlers; (5) Refactored 3 handlers (`handleGetLiveState`, `handleGetFiles`, `handleGetFileContent`) as demonstration - each reduced by ~40 lines. Build compiles; pre-existing test failures unrelated to these changes. |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Extended cognitive load reduction | Continued cognitive load improvements: (1) Refactored 4 more handlers in `handlers_live_state.go` (`handleGetDrift`, `handleKillProcess`, `handleRestartProcess`, `handleProcessControl`) to use `FetchDeploymentContext()`, reducing ~160 lines of boilerplate; (2) Extracted `validateProcessControlRequest()` helper for input validation; (3) Added `NewSSHConfig()` helper in `vps_runners.go` with defaults for Port=22 and User=root; (4) Simplified 4 handlers in `handlers_preflight.go` using `NewSSHConfig()`; (5) Refactored `handleStopScenarioProcesses()` to use early returns and extracted helpers (`writeStopScenarioResponse()`, `workdirExists()`, `stopAllVrooliProcesses()`). Total ~200 lines reduced across files. Build compiles; pre-existing test failures unchanged. |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Further cognitive load reduction | Added `DecodeAndValidateManifest[T]()` generic helper to `http_helpers.go` that consolidates the repeated pattern of decoding JSON → validating manifest → writing error response. Refactored all 6 handlers in `handlers_vps_operations.go` to use this helper, reducing the file from 256 to 159 lines (~38% reduction). Simplified 3 handlers in `handlers_bundle.go` by replacing manual SSHConfig construction with `NewSSHConfig()` helper. Net reduction: 159 lines across handler files with improved consistency and reduced cognitive load when reading VPS operation handlers. Build compiles; 4 pre-existing test failures (fixture issues) unchanged. |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Pattern matching & SSH error handling clarity | (1) Extracted `classifySSHError()` helper in `ssh_keys.go` that consolidates the duplicated SSH error classification pattern (IPv6 hints, timeout detection, auth failure, host unreachable) from `TestSSHConnection` and `CopySSHKeyToServer` into a single switch-based function; (2) Refactored `isExcluded()` in `bundle.go` from a complex 80-line if/else chain into 6 well-named helper functions (`matchesAnywhereSegment`, `matchesAnywhereFile`, `matchesPrefixGlob`, `matchesNestedSegmentGlob`, `advancePastSegment`, `matchesSimpleGlob`) with clear documentation - each pattern type is now understandable in isolation. All `TestIsExcluded` tests pass; build compiles; pre-existing test failures unchanged. |
| 2026-01-03 | Claude Opus 4.5   | Idempotency & replay safety hardening | (1) Added `run_id` and `completed_steps` fields to deployment domain model for tracking execution state; (2) Created `StartDeploymentRun()` repository method with atomic status transition using UPDATE WHERE to prevent race conditions where two concurrent execute requests could both start deployments; (3) Added Caddy config idempotency - now checks if current Caddyfile content matches desired before writing/reloading, avoiding unnecessary service restarts; (4) Added database migration for idempotency tracking columns (`completed_steps JSONB`, `run_id TEXT`); (5) Added repository methods `MarkStepCompleted()`, `GetCompletedSteps()`, `GetRunID()` for step-level idempotency; (6) Created comprehensive `idempotency_test.go` with 5 tests covering Caddy config idempotency, deterministic Caddyfile generation, secrets preservation across redeployments, idempotent scenario stop, and idempotent bundle deletion. All new tests pass; build compiles; pre-existing test failures unchanged. |
