|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Initialization complete | Scaffolded scenario, PRD, and requirements modules for VPS-first cloud packager |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Manifest validation + planning stub | Added manifest schema/validation + `/api/v1/manifest/validate` and `/api/v1/plan` endpoints, CLI commands, and a small UI to validate/plan from JSON. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Test suite green + standards clean | Fixed `.vrooli` schema issues, Makefile/CLI standards violations, UI typecheck, and API health dependency shape; `vrooli scenario test` + `ui-smoke` now pass. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Mini-Vrooli bundling (P0-002) in progress | Implemented deterministic tarball builder + `/api/v1/bundle/build` + CLI/UI wiring and unit tests; updated requirements modules for manifest/bundling/integration refs/status. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | VPS preflight (OT-P0-003) in progress | Added `/api/v1/preflight` with DNS/SSH/OS/disk/RAM/ports/network checks, unit tests, and a `scenario-to-cloud preflight` CLI command; aligned requirement refs and reduced business warnings. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Bundling determinism hardened | Made bundle filename deterministic (sha-based), fixed deterministic ordering for embedded extra files, embedded `.vrooli/cloud/bundle-metadata.json`, and generated `.vrooli/service.json` to only enable required resources. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | VPS install/setup primitives (OT-P0-004) started | Added SSH/SCP-based VPS setup plan + apply primitives (mkdir, scp bundle, extract, run `./scripts/manage.sh setup --yes yes`, write scoped autoheal config, verify vrooli CLI) with API/CLI wiring and unit tests. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | VPS deploy/start primitives (OT-P0-005) started | Added VPS deploy plan + apply endpoints to provision Caddy, start analyzer-derived resources, start dependency scenarios, start target scenario with fixed ports (3000/3001/3002), and verify `/health` locally + via HTTPS; added CLI commands, unit tests, and playbook placeholders. |
| 2025-12-15 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Inspect/log retrieval primitives (OT-P0-006) started | Added VPS inspect plan + apply endpoints to fetch remote `vrooli scenario status --json`, `vrooli resource status --json`, and bounded `vrooli scenario logs` output over SSH; wired CLI commands and tests. |
| 2025-12-16 | Codex (GPT-5.2)   | Mini-bundle go.work trimmed | Bundle now embeds a generated `go.work` that only includes `go.mod` modules present in the mini bundle, avoiding references to stripped scenarios/resources. |
