# Architecture — React Component Library

This document is the scenario's system map. It explains the invariant
shape inherited from the `react-vite` template, then points to the
specialized documents that own product domains, workflows, data,
integrations, deployment, operations, and business strategy.

Keep this file high-signal. Do not turn it into a warehouse for every
domain, endpoint, workflow, or decision. If a concern has a dedicated
document below, update that document and link it here.

## Purpose Of This Document

This document owns:

- the scenario's system shape,
- the role of each surface,
- how contracts and data flow between surfaces,
- the shared infrastructure boundary,
- extension rules for future code,
- architecture maturity and intentional deviations.

This document does not own:

- product capability inventory: [`DOMAINS.md`](DOMAINS.md),
- temporal and user/system workflows: [`FLOWS.md`](FLOWS.md),
- storage details and retention: [`DATA.md`](DATA.md),
- resource and scenario dependencies: [`INTEGRATIONS.md`](INTEGRATIONS.md),
- test seams and fakes: [`../internal/SEAMS.md`](../internal/SEAMS.md),
- test strategy: [`../internal/TESTING.md`](../internal/TESTING.md),
- deployment and operations: [`../operations/DEPLOYMENT.md`](../operations/DEPLOYMENT.md),
- commercial strategy: [`../business/MONETIZATION.md`](../business/MONETIZATION.md).

## Scenario Shape

A scenario is one product expressed through three coordinated surfaces
and one canonical contract layer.

| Surface | Role | Owns | Does Not Own |
|---|---|---|---|
| API (`api/`) | Scenario core | Business rules, persistence, integrations, transport edge | Browser state, CLI formatting |
| UI (`ui/`) | Browser presentation | Components, i18n, accessibility, browser interaction | Business rules, persistence policy |
| CLI (`cli/`) | Operator/agent wrapper | Argument parsing, output formatting, API invocation | Business rules, duplicated validation |
| Contracts (`packages/proto/schemas/react-component-library/`) | Wire shape | Proto messages/services and generated clients | Hand-written route/type mirrors |

The load-bearing principle: the API is the only surface that contains
business logic. UI and CLI translate user/operator intent into API
calls. Proto types flow from one source of truth so wire-shape drift
between surfaces is impossible.

## Registry Projection Flow

Component source remains Git-tracked under `library/components/<slug>/`.
`component.json` owns stable manifest fields, including `slot` and
`designStyles`; version folders own immutable/draft `.tsx` source plus
JSDoc headers such as `@version`, `@deps`, and `@category`. The
components indexer validates both layers and writes SQLite projection
tables:

- `components` for the registry row and adoption `slot`,
- `component_versions` for source snapshots and version status,
- `component_headers` for non-structural latest-version metadata,
- `component_design_affinities` for style fit signals,
- `component_dep_declarations` through the deps observer for
  version-scoped dependency validation and preview import maps.

Design-style IDs are not free text. The canonical vocabulary is loaded
from `templates/design/*/metadata.json`; component manifests that
reference an unknown style fail indexing. The API exposes that registry
through `ComponentsService.ListDesignStyles`, and component search can
filter by style ID and affinity.

## System Boundaries

The scenario owns:

- source code under `api/`, `ui/`, and `cli/`,
- generated-scenario docs under `docs/`,
- scenario lifecycle metadata under `.vrooli/`,
- scenario-specific requirements under `requirements/`,
- scenario proto schemas relocated to
  `packages/proto/schemas/react-component-library/`.

The scenario does not own:

- shared package implementation under `packages/`,
- Vrooli resource implementation,
- scenario dependencies it calls,
- generated proto outputs under `packages/proto/gen/`.

Document dependency and resource decisions in
[`INTEGRATIONS.md`](INTEGRATIONS.md), not here.

## Contracts And Data Flow

Wire shapes do not live in TypeScript interfaces, Go structs, or
hand-written JSON schemas. They live in `.proto` files. For
proto-typed API calls, the `.proto` file also declares the service
block that generates Connect handlers and clients.

```
packages/proto/schemas/react-component-library/v1/<domain>/<file>.proto
       │
       ▼
       make generate
       │
       ├──▶ packages/proto/gen/go/react-component-library/v1/...              (api, cli)
       ├──▶ packages/proto/gen/go/react-component-library/v1/...connect       (Connect-Go)
       ├──▶ packages/proto/gen/typescript/js/react-component-library/v1/...   (ui)
       └──▶ packages/proto/gen/python/react_component_library/v1/...    (future tools)
```

Use Connect-RPC by default:

- UI to API for proto-typed payloads,
- CLI to API for proto-typed payloads,
- API to API / inter-scenario calls with Vrooli-owned protos.

Use REST only when the payload shape is not Vrooli-owned proto data:

- file uploads and other opaque binary edges,
- webhook receivers and third-party APIs in the external system's
  shape,
- operational endpoints that lifecycle systems, load balancers, and
  `curl` probes must reach without a generated client.

If an internal endpoint would be REST only because it is simple, add a
proto service method instead.

## Shared Infrastructure

Shared infrastructure is allowed only when the code is
business-vocabulary-free and used by unrelated domains or surfaces.

| Package/Folder | Purpose | Why Not Domain-Owned | Consumers |
|---|---|---|---|
| `api/internal/server/` | Compose modules and middleware into one HTTP server. | Server lifecycle is not a product capability. | API entrypoint and handler modules. |
| `api/internal/module/` | Shared module and endpoint descriptor types. | Domain modules return this common shape. | Handler packages, server, endpoint codegen. |
| `api/internal/modules/` | Thin registry for schemas and endpoints. | Boot/codegen need central lists; logic stays domain-owned. | `main.go`, `gen-endpoints`. |
| `api/internal/database/` | System schema and DB reachability seam. | Cross-cutting DB infrastructure, not one domain's data. | API boot, health. |
| `api/internal/clock/` | Deterministic time seam. | Time is cross-cutting and test-substitutable. | Middleware, repositories. |
| `api/internal/testutil/` | Cross-domain test harnesses and fakes. | Used by unrelated domains; domain fakes stay domain-local. | API tests. |
| `ui/src/test-utils/` | Cross-feature render helpers, a11y helpers, and model tests. | Used by unrelated UI features. | UI tests. |

If shared infrastructure starts using product vocabulary, move that
piece back into the owning domain or split a new domain first.

## Extension Rules

Add product behavior by adding or updating the owning domain, not by
growing generic buckets.

For a normal proto-backed domain:

1. Add proto messages and service methods under
   `packages/proto/schemas/react-component-library/v1/<domain>/`.
2. Add API domain code under `api/internal/<domain>/`.
3. Add transport code under `api/handlers/<domain>/`.
4. Register schemas/endpoints in `api/internal/modules/registry.go`
   and mount the module in `api/main.go`.
5. Add CLI commands under `cli/domains/<domain>/`.
6. Add UI API wrappers under `ui/src/api/<domain>.ts` and UI feature
   code under `ui/src/features/<domain>/`.
7. Update selectors, strings, endpoints, tests, and the docs contract
   in `docs/manifest.json`.

For detailed product ownership, update [`DOMAINS.md`](DOMAINS.md).
For persistence and retention, update [`DATA.md`](DATA.md). For
temporal behavior, update [`FLOWS.md`](FLOWS.md).

## Architecture Maturity

Generated scenarios start with a mature template shape and starter
reference domains. Replace this table as the scenario becomes real.

| Area | Maturity | Evidence | Remaining Drift |
|---|---|---|---|
| API | Reference-ready | Domain-owned notes stack, module registry, per-domain schema, documented seams. | Starter domains must be replaced with scenario-specific capabilities. |
| UI | Reference-ready | Feature folders, typed API clients, selector/i18n registries, modeltest helpers. | Real scenarios may need routing/state patterns once multiple screens exist. |
| CLI | Reference-ready | Domain command groups wrap API calls and render reports. | New domains must add commands intentionally; CLI should remain thin. |
| Docs | Contract-ready | Manifest v2 registers docs, maturity, stages, and validation hints. | Scenario-specific stubs must be filled or marked not-applicable. |

Use `docs/manifest.json` as the documentation contract. The declared
`maturity` values are expected to be maintained by agents and later
grounded by Knowledge Observatory validation.

## Intentional Deviations

Record deviations from the template or from Vrooli scenario standards
when they are deliberate and durable.

| Date | Deviation | Reason | Revisit Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-12 | None yet. | Generated from `react-vite`. | Update when the scenario intentionally diverges. |

## Documentation Architecture

Scenario docs follow the same ownership rule as code: one durable
question, one canonical home.

| Concern | Canonical Document |
|---|---|
| System map and extension rules | `docs/concepts/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Product capabilities and bounded contexts | `docs/concepts/DOMAINS.md` |
| Workflows and state transitions | `docs/concepts/FLOWS.md` |
| Data ownership, retention, and migrations | `docs/concepts/DATA.md` |
| Resources, scenarios, and external services | `docs/concepts/INTEGRATIONS.md` |
| Monetization and packaging | `docs/business/MONETIZATION.md` |
| Go-to-market strategy | `docs/business/GO-TO-MARKET.md` |
| Deployment tiers and readiness | `docs/operations/DEPLOYMENT.md` |
| Operator procedures | `docs/operations/RUNBOOK.md` |
| Telemetry, metrics, and alerts | `docs/operations/OBSERVABILITY.md` |
| Seams and test doubles | `docs/internal/SEAMS.md` |
| Testing strategy | `docs/internal/TESTING.md` |
| Known drift and deferred work | `docs/internal/PROBLEMS.md` |
| Change history | `docs/internal/PROGRESS.md` |

Every durable scenario document should be registered in
`docs/manifest.json`. Put deep domain-specific documentation under
`docs/domains/<domain>/` when `DOMAINS.md` would become noisy.
