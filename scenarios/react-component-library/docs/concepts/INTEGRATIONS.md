# Integrations — React Component Library

This document is the canonical dependency contract for resources,
other scenarios, and third-party services used by the scenario.

## Purpose Of This Document

Use this document to answer:

- What does the scenario depend on?
- Which dependencies are required versus optional?
- Which domain uses each dependency?
- What is the failure or degradation behavior?
- Where is the dependency declared or configured?

## Dependency Inventory

| Dependency | Type | Required? | Used By | Contract | Failure Behavior |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SQLite | embedded storage | yes | API, notes reference | resolved by `api-core/storage` from the scenario id | API reports unhealthy if unreachable. |
| Vrooli lifecycle | local platform | yes | API, UI, CLI | `.vrooli/service.json`, Makefile targets | Scenario should be started through lifecycle commands. |
| Agent Manager | scenario | no | Assisted extraction and adoption workflows | `.vrooli/service.json`, `/api/v1/capabilities/describe` | Assisted workflows remain unavailable; direct catalog and adoption APIs remain available. |

## Vrooli Resources

The generated template does not declare external Vrooli resources. Add
resources to `.vrooli/service.json` only when a real scenario domain
requires them.

| Resource | Status | Reason | Revisit Trigger |
|---|---|---|---|
| None yet. | not-applicable | SQLite is embedded by default. | Add when PRD/requirements demand shared resource behavior. |

## Scenario Dependencies

| Scenario | Status | Reason | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent Manager | optional | Provides server-side execution for attributable assisted extraction and adoption workflows. | `/api/v1/capabilities/describe`; `vrooli scenario start agent-manager --json` |

## Third-Party Services

| Service | Status | Reason | Contract |
|---|---|---|---|
| None yet. | not-applicable | No external third-party service is required; Agent Manager is a Vrooli scenario dependency. | Add when a non-Vrooli service is introduced. |

## Failure Modes

| Dependency | Failure Signal | Expected Behavior | Tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| SQLite | `PingContext` error | `/health` returns unhealthy dependency status. | health handler tests |
| Agent Manager | lifecycle status unavailable or dispatch error | Assisted workflow is stored as unavailable; direct catalog and adoption APIs remain available. | workflow service tests |
