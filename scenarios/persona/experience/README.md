# experience/ - UX Contract

This folder is the scenario's generated **experience contract**. It is the
design-first sibling of `requirements/`: requirements say what the scenario
does, while `experience/` says what the UI must communicate.

The template starts at **L0** on purpose. Each page spec declares identity,
route, purpose, and operational-target linkage only. As the product becomes
real, raise the depth:

- L1: add communication priorities.
- L2: add elements, claims, and bindings.
- L3: add explicit states.
- L4: add journeys that connect pages.

Use `experience-manager spec validate persona --json` after edits.
Machine-tier claims should only be added when the UI has stable selectors and
the claim can be checked by the experience phase. Manual claims need
attestations with expiry; aspirational claims are useful intent but never gate.

The template example page has been removed. The remaining page specs are the
scenario's real dashboard, persona, handoff, journal, and settings surfaces.
Keep the semantic boundary for every independently meaningful async region;
passive UI primitives inherit their parent state.
