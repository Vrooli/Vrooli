## Auto-sync Behavior

Requirements are linked to PRD operational targets via the `prd_ref` field. When operational targets are updated in the PRD:
1. New targets should have corresponding requirements added
2. Removed targets should have their requirements reviewed for relevance
3. Run `prd-control-tower requirements validate` to check for linkage issues

## Validation Commands

```bash
# Validate requirements against PRD
prd-control-tower requirements validate elo-swipe

# Check PRD quality (includes requirements validation)
prd-control-tower prd validate elo-swipe
```

## Test Tagging

Tag tests with requirement IDs to track coverage:
```go
// [REQ:REQ-P0-001] Test file compression functionality
func TestFileCompression(t *testing.T) { ... }
```
