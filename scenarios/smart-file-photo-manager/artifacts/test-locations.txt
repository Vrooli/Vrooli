## Test Statistics
- Total test cases: 103
- Current coverage: 35.4%
- Target coverage: 80%
- Test execution time: <1 second

## Key Achievements
✅ 103 comprehensive test cases
✅ Gold-standard patterns from visited-tracker
✅ Systematic error testing
✅ Boundary condition validation
✅ Performance benchmarking
✅ Centralized testing integration
✅ Dynamic schema-aware test helpers

## Known Issues
⚠️ Database schema incompatibilities prevent some integration tests
⚠️ Worker/processing pipeline needs additional test coverage
⚠️ AI/ML integration mocking required for full coverage

## Next Steps for 80% Coverage
1. Resolve database schema NOT NULL constraints
2. Add worker pool and processing tests (+15-20%)
3. Mock AI/ML services for integration tests (+10-15%)
4. Complete extractor function tests (+5-10%)
5. Implement remaining handler tests (+10-15%)
