# Seams — Scenario Completeness Scoring

A **seam** is a deliberate boundary where production code calls an
interface, not a concrete dependency. The fake substitutes through that
interface in tests; production wires the real implementation once at the
composition edge (`main.go` for cross-cutting dependencies, or the
domain's `handlers/<domain>/module.go` for domain-local dependencies).

This document is the authoritative list of seams in this scenario. Add
to it whenever you introduce a new interface that production wires once
and tests substitute. Remove from it only when the seam is genuinely
gone — not when "we don't fake it yet."

## Wire contracts live in proto, not seams

Before adding a new seam, ask: is this a *boundary* (a place where
production-vs-test substitution matters) or a *contract* (a payload
shape consumed by multiple processes)? Wire contracts belong in
`packages/proto/schemas/scenario-completeness-scoring/v1/<domain>/<file>.proto` —
NOT in interfaces. The generated Go + TypeScript types are the
canonical types every test, handler, and UI component reads from.

The `health` proto in `packages/proto/schemas/scenario-completeness-scoring/v1/health/`
is the worked example. The Go fixture (`api/internal/testutil/fixtures/health.go`)
re-exports the generated `Response` and provides functional-options
builders; the UI factory (`ui/src/test-utils/factories.ts`) builds
the same generated type via `create(ResponseSchema, ...)`. Drift
between the two is impossible because both consume one source of
truth.

For proto-typed API calls, the service block in the proto is also the
transport contract. Generated Connect-Go handlers and Connect-Web/Go
clients are the seam at the wire boundary. REST remains intentional
only where the payload is not proto-typed, such as multipart file
uploads; the response metadata still uses generated proto types.

If a piece of production code reaches for `time.Now()`, `*sql.DB`, or
the network without going through one of the entries below, that's a
new seam that hasn't been declared yet. Declaring it is the work — the
test ergonomics fall out for free.

## Workflow transitions are not seams

Temporal workflow logic is domain policy. A workflow file such as
`internal/<domain>/workflow.go` or
`ui/src/features/<domain>/<domain>Workflow.ts` defines allowed
state/event transitions and invariants; production and tests call the
same transition function directly.

The seams are the side-effect boundaries around that workflow:

- repositories that persist the state,
- BlobStore or filesystem clients that store opaque bytes,
- clocks, timers, schedulers, and retry drivers,
- outbound HTTP clients and other scenario clients,
- UI API modules that issue network requests.

Keep the rule split explicit:

```
handler/component/job
  -> call pure workflow transition
  -> perform side effects through seams
  -> persist/render the resulting state
```

If a test needs to substitute a dependency, add or reuse a seam. If a
test only needs to prove the state machine, call the workflow directly
and use matrix/trace helpers from the relevant testutil package.

## How to read this file

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Short name used to refer to the boundary in conversation. |
| **Interface** | Go file & symbol that defines the contract. |
| **Production wiring** | Where the real implementation is constructed. |
| **Test fake** | The fake under `internal/testutil/mocks/` (cross-domain) or `internal/<dom>/mocks/` (per-domain) that substitutes. |
| **Why it exists** | The class of bug it prevents or the test ergonomic it enables. |

## Current seams

### Clock

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Wall-clock time |
| **Interface** | `internal/clock/clock.go::Clock` (`Now() time.Time`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` constructs `clock.System{}` and passes it via `server.Deps`. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/testutil/mocks::FakeClock` (`Now`, `Advance`, `SetNow`). |
| **Why it exists** | Middleware computes request-duration log lines from two `Now()` calls. With `time.Now()` direct, duration assertions are flaky on loaded CI and undefined on fast hardware. With `FakeClock.Advance(150 * time.Millisecond)` inside the inner handler, the duration string is bit-for-bit deterministic. See `internal/middleware/logging_test.go::TestLoggingMiddleware_LogsDuration`. |

### Pinger (database reachability)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Database reachability probe |
| **Interface** | `internal/database/pinger.go::Pinger` (`PingContext(ctx) error`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` opens `*sql.DB` via `database.Connect(...)` against `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure-Go, CGO-clean). `*sql.DB` satisfies `Pinger` directly — no wrapper. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/testutil/mocks::FakePinger` (`PingErr error`, atomic `Calls` counter). |
| **Why it exists** | The `/health` handler probes the database. Without the seam, every handler test would either open the on-disk SQLite file (slow at scale, parallel-test contention) or skip the database branch entirely (untested degradation path). With `FakePinger{PingErr: errors.New("connection refused")}`, the unhealthy branch is one line. See `handlers/health/handler_test.go`. |

### database.SchemaExecer (shared schema application)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Shared api-core schema execution surface |
| **Interface** | `api-core/database::SchemaExecer` (`ExecContext(ctx, query, args...)`) consumed by `database.EnsureSchemas`. |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` and sqlite tests pass a real `*sql.DB`; `modules.AllSchemas()` composes scenario-specific providers (`localdb.SystemSchema`, per-domain schemas) before applying them. |
| **Test fake** | `api-core/databasetest::FakeExecer` is the canonical fake when a test needs to assert schema application order or injected execution failures without opening a real database. |
| **Why it exists** | Schema application is shared-package behavior, but each scenario owns its provider list. Keep scenario-specific schema composition local; use `databasetest.FakeExecer` only for tests of code that consumes the shared `SchemaExecer` interface directly. |

### Connect router (proto-typed transport)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Generated Connect services mounted on the scenario's existing mux router |
| **Interface** | `api-core/connectx::RegisterServices(router, mounts...)`, where each mount is `{Path, Handler}` returned by generated `New<Domain>Handler(...)` |
| **Production wiring** | `handlers/<domain>/module.go` constructs the domain service, passes it to `NewConnectHandler`, then mounts the generated handler with `connectx.RegisterServices`. The server's existing middleware still wraps the handler because Connect is standard `http.Handler`. |
| **Test fake** | `api-core/connectxtest::StartTestServer` is the canonical in-process server harness for handler tests. `connectxtest.NewLogger` is the canonical logger capture helper. Module tests can still mount the module on a mux router and issue real HTTP requests. No hand-written request JSON ribbon is needed in tests. |
| **Why it exists** | The proto service descriptor becomes the single wire contract for UI, CLI, and API. Handler path, method, request type, response type, and Connect error envelope all come from generated code instead of parallel route tables. |

### cliapp RunContext (CLI handler test context)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Shared cli-core command handler context |
| **Interface** | `cli-core/cliapp::RunContext` plus `ArgSchema` parser inputs. |
| **Production wiring** | The CLI dispatcher builds `RunContext` through cli-core's parser and injects the scenario app, stdout, stderr, and built-in `--json` state. |
| **Test fake** | `cli-core/cliapptest::NewTestRunContext` and `NewTestRunContextFromArgs` are the canonical constructors for tests that drive `RunCtx` handlers directly. |
| **Why it exists** | CLI domain tests should exercise handler behavior without duplicating parser setup or relying on `cliapp`'s inline test exports. The sibling test companion keeps future CLI tests aligned with shared-package test-helper ownership. |

### cli/manifest.json ↔ handlers bindings (CLI command surface)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Declarative CLI command surface — single source of truth for groups, commands, args, governance, and proto-method bindings. |
| **Interface** | `cli/manifest.json` validated against `.vrooli/schemas/cli-manifest.schema.json` (`cli-manifest/v1`); resolved via `repocontract.ScenarioCLIManifestPath`; consumed by `cliapp.LoadFromManifest(raw, groupName, bindings)` where `bindings` is `map["<Service>.<Method>"]func(RunContext) error`. |
| **Production wiring** | `cli/manifest_embed.go` embeds the manifest bytes; `cli/app.go` passes them to `domains.SubcommandGroups(core, manifest)`; each domain's `Register(core, manifest)` calls `cliapp.LoadFromManifest` with its group name and a bindings map keyed by `Service.Method`. |
| **Test fake** | `cli-core/cliapp::RequireProtoServiceCoverage(t, manifest, fd, serviceName)` asserts every RPC on the bound proto service has either a binding or an entry in the manifest's `omitted` array — see `cli/domains/scores/scores_manifest_test.go`. `cliapp.ParseManifest` covers structural validation in isolation. |
| **Why it exists** | Without this seam, adding a new RPC to the proto compiles fine while the CLI silently lacks a corresponding command, and prompt-manager has no governance signal — every action falls back to `CertaintyOwnerOnly` and is rejected. The manifest crystallises both the command surface and the safety properties (effect, run_eligible, permissions, requires_confirmation) so the coverage test fails fast and prompt-manager can derive certainty automatically. |

### BlobStore (opaque bytes)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Binary object storage for REST multipart edges |
| **Interface** | `api-core/blobstore::BlobStore` (`Put`, `Get`, `Delete`) |
| **Production wiring** | A domain module that exposes multipart endpoints owns its blob store (none in this scenario today — the seam ships from `api-core/blobstore` for the first domain that needs opaque bytes). |
| **Test fake** | `api-core/blobstore.MemoryBlobStore` or a domain-local fake lets handler tests assert metadata and failure behavior without touching the filesystem. |
| **Why it exists** | Connect-RPC is the default for proto-typed payloads, but opaque bytes are not proto payloads. Keeping bytes behind `BlobStore` lets the handler stay transport-focused and lets future scenarios swap filesystem, S3, or another object store without changing domain services. |

### module.Module (domain composition)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Domain-to-server composition; the contract every handler package returns from its `Module(...)` constructor. |
| **Interface** | `internal/module/module.go::Module` (`Name string`, `Mount func(r *mux.Router)`, `Endpoints []EndpointDescriptor`). Data type, not behaviour — modules don't have methods. |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` calls `healthH.Module(...)`, `scoringH.Module(...)`, ..., and passes the slice to `server.New(deps, modules...)`. The server iterates `m.Mount(s.router)` after registering the logging middleware. |
| **Test fake** | A literal `module.Module{Name: "stub", Mount: func(r){...}}` in `internal/server/server_test.go` proves the iteration; per-domain `module_test.go` files (`handlers/scoring/`, `handlers/health/`) exercise the real constructors against in-memory fixtures. |
| **Why it exists** | Eliminates the central registry that would otherwise grow per-domain fields on `server.Deps` and per-domain wiring lines in `routes.go`. Adding a domain means creating files; deleting one means removing files. The endpoint descriptors travel with the module, so `.vrooli/endpoints.json` codegen has a single source per domain (no manual JSON editing). |

### Endpoints codegen (manifest source-of-truth)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | The `.vrooli/endpoints.json` API documentation manifest. |
| **Interface** | `api/cmd/gen-endpoints/main.go` reads `internal/modules.AllEndpoints()` — the shared registry that collects each handler's static `Endpoints []module.EndpointDescriptor` slice plus `cli_commands_seed.json`. Output is the canonical envelope at `.vrooli/endpoints.json`. |
| **Production wiring** | Run via `make endpoints`. CI runs `make endpoints && git diff --exit-code .vrooli/endpoints.json` so a stale manifest fails the build with an actionable diff. |
| **Test fake** | `api/cmd/gen-endpoints/main_test.go` exercises the codegen with hand-built fixtures and asserts the output is valid JSON with the canonical envelope. `internal/modules/registry_test.go` pins the registry shape (non-empty, stable order). The manifest coverage gate (every Connect endpoint is bound or explicitly omitted in `cli/manifest.json`) has its own unit test. |
| **Why it exists** | Hand-edited endpoints manifests drift from real handlers. The shared `modules` registry means runtime (`main.go`) and codegen (`gen-endpoints`) read endpoints + schema from one place — adding a domain is two registry lines, not separate edits in `main.go` and `gen-endpoints/main.go`. The CI drift check makes "I forgot to regenerate" a build failure, not a stale-doc bug. |

### database.SystemSchema (cross-cutting infrastructure)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Cross-cutting database infrastructure (postgres extensions, custom types, cross-domain views) |
| **Interface** | `internal/database/system.go::SystemSchema() string` (consumed via `api-core/database.SchemaProvider`) |
| **Production wiring** | `internal/modules/registry.go::AllSchemas()` lists `apidb.SchemaProviderFunc(localdb.SystemSchema)` first; `main.go` passes the slice into `apidb.EnsureSchemas`. |
| **Test fake** | None. The system file ships empty in the template and is verified empty by `internal/database/system_test.go::TestSystemSchema_IsEmpty` (a deliberate tripwire — adding a `CREATE TABLE` here forces a "yes, this is genuinely cross-cutting" decision). |
| **Why it exists** | Some bits don't belong to any one domain — postgres extensions, type definitions, reporting views. Putting them in a domain package would force fictional ownership. The system home is honest: cross-cutting goes here, single-domain bits go in `internal/<dom>/schema.sql`. |

### Per-domain Schema providers

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Domain-owned SQL contribution |
| **Interface** | `internal/<domain>/schema.go::Schema() string` (consumed via the handler package's `Schema` re-export, then `api-core/database.SchemaProvider`). The scoring domain owns `score_snapshots` through `internal/scoring/schema.sql`. |
| **Production wiring** | `internal/modules/registry.go::AllSchemas()` lists each domain's `apidb.SchemaProviderFunc(<dom>H.Schema)`; applied at boot via `apidb.EnsureSchemas`. |
| **Test fake** | Domain repository tests compose `db.NewSQLite(t)` + `apidb.EnsureSchemas(...)` with the system + own-domain providers, never the central registry. |
| **Why it exists** | Domain ownership of the schema. Adding a column lands in the same diff as the Go change; deleting `internal/<domain>/` deletes the table definition with it, so removed domains do not leave tables created on boot. The handler-package `Schema` re-export keeps the registry's import surface narrow — it imports handler packages, not their internal peers. |

### Score snapshots repository

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Score history persistence |
| **Interface** | `internal/scoring/repository.go::SnapshotRepository` (`LatestFor`, `LatestDifferingDigest`, `SeriesFor`, `UpsertSnapshot`, `ListPage`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` constructs `scoring.NewSQLiteSnapshotRepository(db)` with the `*database.RoutedDB` handle and passes it to the scoring Connect module, measures module, and background sweeper. Boot schema application still uses `db.Primary()` because schema creation is not request-routed. |
| **Test fake** | Repository tests use `internal/testutil/db.NewSQLite` plus the real schema; sweeper tests use a domain-local in-memory fake in `internal/scoring/sweeper_test.go`. |
| **Why it exists** | The fleet list/trend read paths must be O(query) over persisted state, while the background sweeper remains the single writer. Keeping the repository interface in the scoring domain lets tests prove digest-deduping and pagination without coupling handlers or workers to SQLite. |

### Measures registry surface

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Measures-health discovery/execution boundary |
| **Interface** | `api/handlers/measures/measures.go::Store` plus `measures-go/serve.Registry` declarations for `scoring.fleet-below-rung`, `scoring.average-composite`, and `scoring.score-series`. |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` passes the concrete snapshot repository into `measures.Module(...)`; the module mounts `/measures/declarations`, `/measures/execute`, and the generated `MeasuresService` Connect handlers. |
| **Test fake** | `api/handlers/measures/measures_test.go` uses an in-memory fake store and a fixed clock to prove declarations, registry execution, provenance, default windows, and Connect parity. |
| **Why it exists** | Measures are an inter-scenario federation contract, but they must remain backed by the scoring domain's persisted read model. The seam keeps measures-health/search-hub integration from reaching into SQLite directly and preserves O(query) fleet behavior. |

### Score sweep scenario lister

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Fleet enumeration for background score snapshots |
| **Interface** | `internal/scoring/sweeper.go::ScenarioLister` (`ListScenarios(root)`) |
| **Production wiring** | `scoring.DirectoryScenarioLister` lists first-level directories under the resolved scenarios root. `main.go` uses it through `NewSweeper` defaults. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/scoring/sweeper_test.go::fakeScenarioLister` supplies deterministic fleets. |
| **Why it exists** | The sweeper must be testable without depending on the operator's local scenario directory count or names. |

### Score sweep digest computer

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Digest-first score-skip decision |
| **Interface** | `internal/scoring/sweeper.go::DigestComputer` (`ComputeDigest(root)`) |
| **Production wiring** | `scoring.TreeDigestComputer` delegates to `freshness-go/treedigest.Compute`. `main.go` uses it through `NewSweeper` defaults. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/scoring/sweeper_test.go::fakeDigester` returns fixed digests or injected errors. |
| **Why it exists** | The fleet-scale invariant depends on skipping unchanged scenarios before score computation. Tests need to prove unchanged digests do not call the scorer. |

### Score sweep scorer

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Per-scenario score computation inside the background sweeper |
| **Interface** | `internal/scoring/sweeper.go::SweepScorer` (`GetScore(scenario)`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` constructs a scoring `Service` with optional importance enrichment disabled for sweep writes and passes it to `NewSweeper`. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/scoring/sweeper_test.go::fakeSweepScorer` records call counts, blocks for single-flight tests, and returns fixed score results. |
| **Why it exists** | The sweeper owns persistence policy, not score math. The seam keeps digest-skip and single-writer behavior independently testable. |

### Score sweep timing

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Background sweep cadence and startup staggering |
| **Interface** | `internal/scoring/sweeper.go::SweeperConfig` (`Interval`, `InitialJitter`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` reads `SCS_SCORE_SWEEP_INTERVAL` and `SCS_SCORE_SWEEP_START_JITTER`; absent an explicit start jitter, it chooses a per-process startup delay up to one tenth of the interval, capped at one minute. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/scoring/sweeper_test.go::TestSweeperRunLoopHonorsInitialJitter` uses a short configured jitter and fixed interval to prove no score work starts before the startup delay. |
| **Why it exists** | Fleet sweeps are background maintenance. Startup staggering avoids a thundering herd when multiple scenario API processes restart together, while preserving fast deterministic tests through explicit timing injection. |

### Doer (outbound HTTP)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Outbound HTTP request boundary |
| **Interface** | `internal/httpc/doer.go::Doer` (`Do(*http.Request) (*http.Response, error)`) |
| **Production wiring** | Ships unwired in production by intent (no consumer until a real outbound call lands). `*http.Client` satisfies `Doer` directly via the compile-time assertion in `doer.go`; the first scenario to need an outbound call adds the field to `server.Deps` and wires `&http.Client{Timeout: …}` from `main.go`. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/testutil/mocks::FakeDoer` (canned `*http.Response` queue, recorded `*http.Request` log, atomic `Calls` counter). |
| **Why it exists** | Network calls in handler tests would be flaky and slow. Defining the seam *before* the first consumer means the first scenario to call outward doesn't reinvent ad-hoc mocking. Pattern proven in `scenarios/agent-manager/api/internal/promptmanager/client.go`. See `internal/httpc/doer_test.go` for the substitution reference. |

## Adding a new seam

The right time to add a seam is the moment you find yourself reaching
past `*sql.DB`, `http.Get`, or `os.OpenFile` from a handler/service. The
process is mechanical.

## Architecture Alignment Notes

Use this section for durable boundary decisions discovered during
screaming-architecture work. Keep the full mental model in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../concepts/ARCHITECTURE.md); this table records
why a boundary lives where it does and what still needs follow-up.

| Area | Drift | Decision | Follow-up |
|---|---|---|---|
| Domain-specific fakes | Earlier templates often put every fake under shared testutil. | One-domain fakes live under `api/internal/<domain>/mocks/`; cross-domain fakes stay under `api/internal/testutil/mocks/`. | Preserve this split when adding new domains. |
| Temporal workflow side effects | Async flows can bury transition rules inside handlers/components. | Pure workflow transitions are domain policy; side effects remain behind seams. | See [`FLOWS.md`](../concepts/FLOWS.md) for modeled flows. |
| Domain schemas | Central schema files make domain deletion and ownership harder. | Domain tables live beside domain code; `internal/database/system.sql` is only for genuinely cross-cutting DB infrastructure. | If a table is added to system schema, document why it is not domain-owned. |

### Domain-scoped packages, not generic `services/`

When a seam belongs to a domain (scoring, tasks, users, …), it lives in
`internal/<domain>/`, NOT in `internal/database/` or
`internal/services/`. A persistence-owning domain follows this layout:

```
internal/<domain>/
  types.go         # Entity, CreateInput, typed error sentinels
  repository.go    # Repository interface
  sqlite.go        # NewSQLiteRepository (production impl)
  sqlite_test.go   # Repository tests against real sqlite
  service.go       # Service interface + impl (validation, defaults)
  service_test.go  # Service tests against FakeRepository
  schema.sql       # Domain-owned table DDL (Pass-3 pattern)
  schema.go        # //go:embed schema.sql + Schema() string
  schema_test.go   # Embed-content tripwire
  mocks/           # Co-located test fakes (package mocks)
    repository.go
    service.go
    repository_test.go
    service_test.go
```

Mocks are co-located under `internal/<dom>/mocks/`, NOT under
`internal/testutil/mocks/`. `mocks/repository.go` defines
`FakeRepository`; `mocks/service.go` defines `FakeService`. Deleting
`internal/<dom>/` takes the mocks, schema, and tests along in one
sweep.

`internal/database/` retains only cross-cutting infrastructure
(`Pinger`, `SystemSchema` for the empty/cross-cutting SQL home) —
never domain-specific interfaces.

`internal/testutil/mocks/` retains only cross-domain fakes
(`FakeClock`, `FakePinger`, `FakeDoer`).

### Mechanical steps

1. **Define the interface in a domain package.** Methods are exactly
   what callers need — no more, no less. Example:
   ```go
   // internal/tasks/repository.go
   package tasks

   type Repository interface {
       Create(ctx context.Context, t Task) (Task, error)
       Get(ctx context.Context, id string) (Task, error)
   }
   ```
2. **Implement it in production with the concrete dependency wrapped
   in an unexported struct.** The struct holds `*sql.DB`; the methods
   translate domain calls to SQL. Production wires this in `main.go`;
   tests never see it.
3. **Add a service alongside the repository.** Even if `Service`
   currently does nothing more than pass through, define it now —
   handlers should depend on the service, not the repository, so
   future validation/policy has a home that doesn't require a handler
   refactor.
4. **Add fakes in `internal/<domain>/mocks/`** (co-located with the
   domain, `package mocks`) named `repository.go` and `service.go`.
   Each method takes a per-method error knob (`CreateErr error`) plus
   any state it needs to return. Counters use `atomic.Int64`, not plain
   `int`, so race-detector tests don't flap. Cross-domain fakes
   (`FakeClock`, `FakePinger`, `FakeDoer`) stay in
   `internal/testutil/mocks/`.
5. **Update this document.** A row in the table above with the same
   five columns. If you skip this step, the seam exists but isn't
   discoverable — future readers will reinvent it parallel.
6. **Add `var _` compile-time assertions** wherever the interface is
   defined: `var _ Repository = (*sqliteRepository)(nil)`. The
   assertion moves "this concrete type satisfies the interface" from a
   runtime surprise into a compile error.

## UI-side seams

The UI uses different mechanisms (Vitest's `vi.mock` hoisting), but
the goal is the same: production wires once, tests substitute.

### `api/client::transport` (Connect-Web transport)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Single Connect-Web transport factory for proto-typed UI API calls |
| **Module** | `ui/src/api/client.ts` exports `transport` from `@vrooli/api-base::createScenarioConnectTransport`, plus REST-only helpers (`ApiError`, `decodeApiError`, `makeApiError`, `uploadFile`) for multipart exceptions. |
| **Production wiring** | Every proto-typed domain client imports `transport` and constructs a generated client with `createClient(<Service>, transport)`. REST multipart helpers use `uploadFile()` and parse the metadata response with the generated proto descriptor. |
| **Test fake** | Component tests mock `api/<domain>` modules or typed client methods. REST helper tests stub `global.fetch` directly. Connect behavior is covered at the API boundary by the generated client and focused module tests. |
| **Why it exists** | Per-domain clients should not know URL suffix rules, fetch setup, or proto JSON parse details. Connect-Web centralizes those choices, while the REST helpers make the binary-upload exception explicit instead of becoming a second general transport pattern. |

### `api/<domain>` (per-domain client modules)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | UI ↔ API per-domain endpoints (canonical reference: `api/scoring.ts`) |
| **Module** | `ui/src/api/scoring.ts` exports `scoringClient = createClient(ScoreService, transport)` and the `fetchScore(scenario)` wrapper the feature consumes. |
| **Production wiring** | Feature components wire generated client methods through `useQuery`, e.g. `useQuery({ queryKey: ["score", scenario], queryFn: () => fetchScore(scenario) })` in `ui/src/features/scoring/ScoreDashboard.tsx`. |
| **Test fake** | Component tests use inline `vi.mock("../../api/scoring", async (importOriginal) => ...)` with the co-located builder `features/scoring/mocks/scoring.ts::makeScoringMocks()`. Factories (`features/scoring/mocks/factories.ts`) build generated proto types via `create(<Schema>, overrides)`. |
| **Why it exists** | The canonical per-domain client pattern. Mirror this shape when adding a second domain client: export the generated Connect client, keep transport helpers beside it when needed, and let components consume typed results rather than hand-written response interfaces. |

### ErrorBoundary (render-error catch)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Boundary** | App-level render-error catch |
| **Module** | `ui/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (class component with `getDerivedStateFromError` + `componentDidCatch`) |
| **Production wiring** | `ui/src/main.tsx` wraps `<App />` inside `<QueryClientProvider>`; the boundary catches any render-time exception thrown by `App` or its descendants and shows the localised default fallback. |
| **Test fake** | None — the boundary is the system-under-test. `ui/src/components/ErrorBoundary.test.tsx` drives it with a controlled-throw fixture (`Throw({ when })`). |
| **Why it exists** | Render-time exceptions silently nuke the page in raw React (white screen, no recovery). Every mature Vrooli scenario hand-rolls a class boundary; the template ships one as the canonical pattern. The `onError` prop is exposed for telemetry sinks (Sentry, etc.); the template wires nothing in production by intent — scenarios add their own sink as needed. |

### Scorer (Connect handler ↔ score assembly)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Score computation behind the ScoreService handler |
| **Interface** | `api/handlers/scoring/connect_handler.go::Scorer` (`GetScore(scenario) (scoring.Result, error)`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` constructs `internal/scoring.New()` (which resolves the Vrooli repo root at boot) and passes it to `scoringH.Module`. |
| **Test fake** | In-file `stubScorer` in `connect_handler_test.go`. |
| **Why it exists** | Handler tests pin the domain→proto conversion and error mapping (ErrUnknownScenario → NOT_FOUND) without touching the filesystem or a real scenarios tree. |

### Scenarios root + clock (scoring service)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Filesystem root the scorer reads scenarios from, and the payload timestamp |
| **Interface** | `api/internal/scoring/service.go::WithScenariosRoot`, `::WithClock` options |
| **Production wiring** | `New()` defaults: `VROOLI_ROOT` env override else repo-contract discovery; `time.Now`. |
| **Test fake** | `WithScenariosRoot(t.TempDir())` + fixture scenario trees (see `service_test.go::TestGetScoreStalenessLoop`). |
| **Why it exists** | The end-to-end staleness loop (fresh → edit → stale → revert → fresh) must be deterministic against a synthetic scenario; without the root option every test would need the real repo checkout. |

### Freshness inputs (digest + run index)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Tree-digest computation and run-index loading |
| **Interface** | `api/internal/freshness/freshness.go::Service{ComputeDigest, LoadRecords}` function fields |
| **Production wiring** | `New()` binds `treedigest.Compute` and `runindex.Load` from `packages/freshness-go`. |
| **Test fake** | `fixedService(...)` in `freshness_test.go` returns canned digests/records. |
| **Why it exists** | Verdict-assembly tests (fresh/stale/unknown, digest-failure degradation) must not depend on git state or real coverage artifacts. The semantics themselves are NOT a seam — they live in freshness-go and are reused verbatim. |

### Signal collectors (circuit-breaker registry)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Per-source artifact decoding behind the collector registry |
| **Interface** | `api/internal/signals/collect.go::Collector` (`Name()`, `Collect(*Snapshot) error`) |
| **Production wiring** | `signals.NewService()` registers service → requirements → phases → ui, each behind a circuit breaker (3 failures opens, 30s retry). |
| **Test fake** | Fixture artifact trees under `t.TempDir()` per collector test; the registry tests inject failing/panicking collectors to pin the recover-to-degradation path. |
| **Why it exists** | OT-P0-006: malformed cached artifacts must degrade that one signal (visible in `Snapshot.Degradations`) and never crash the score path. |

### i18n singleton (locale state)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Active locale + translation lookup |
| **Module** | `ui/src/i18n/index.ts` (`i18n`, `setLocale`, `getCurrentLocale`, `useTranslation`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.tsx` imports the module, which initialises i18next as a process-wide singleton. Components consume via `useTranslation()`. |
| **Test fake** | `test-setup.ts` switches the singleton into `cimode` before every test (so `t('app.title')` returns the literal key `"app.title"`). Tests that need real-locale behaviour opt back in via `await setLocale("en")` in their own `beforeEach`. |
| **Why it exists** | Module-level singleton is intentional — i18next's React integration assumes one instance per renderer. The seam is the *configuration* (what locale is active), not the *interface*. cimode + the typed `strings.*` registry let tests assert on key paths instead of brittle copy. |

## What is NOT a seam

- **Pure-function helpers** (`internal/i18n/format.go`). They have no
  dependencies; tests call them directly. No interface required.
- **Standard-library types you don't control** (`time.Duration`, `url.URL`).
  The cost of a seam is overhead unless you'd otherwise be tempted to
  reach for global state.
- **Configuration structs** read once at startup. The seam is the
  *consumer* of the config, not the loader.
- **Generated proto types.** They're contracts, not seams. See "Wire
  contracts live in proto, not seams" above.

## API contract manifest

Not a seam (no production-vs-test substitution), but worth listing
here for discoverability: `.vrooli/endpoints.json` is the canonical
declaration of every public HTTP endpoint plus its CLI mirror. Doc
generators, Postman collection builders, and SDK-stub tooling read it.

**The file is generated** from each handler module's
Connect service metadata plus each handler module's
`Endpoints []module.EndpointDescriptor` slice (see the
"Endpoints codegen" seam above). To add or change a public operation:

1. Update the proto service and generated Connect handler for
   proto-typed operations, or update the REST handler for a documented
   exception such as multipart upload.
2. Keep the descriptor metadata in `api/handlers/<dom>/module.go`
   aligned with the operation. Connect paths use the generated service
   path; REST exceptions use the explicit REST path and error envelope.
3. If the operation has a CLI mirror, add or update the matching row in
   `api/cmd/gen-endpoints/cli_commands_seed.json`.
4. Run `make endpoints` to regenerate `.vrooli/endpoints.json`.
5. Commit both the descriptor edit AND the regenerated manifest.

The CI drift check (`make endpoints && git diff --exit-code
.vrooli/endpoints.json`) fails the build if step 4 was skipped, with
an actionable diff showing exactly which entries diverged.
