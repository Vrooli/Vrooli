# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 🎯 Capability Definition

### Core Capability
**What permanent capability does this scenario add to Vrooli?**
Knowledge Observatory provides real-time introspection and management of Vrooli's semantic memory system stored in Qdrant. It enables monitoring knowledge health, detecting semantic drift, identifying knowledge gaps, and understanding how the system's understanding evolves over time - essentially acting as a consciousness monitor for Vrooli's collective intelligence.

### Intelligence Amplification
**How does this capability make future agents smarter?**
By providing visibility into what knowledge exists and its quality, agents can:
- Avoid adding redundant knowledge by checking what already exists
- Identify knowledge gaps before attempting complex tasks
- Understand semantic relationships between concepts to make better connections
- Learn from knowledge evolution patterns to improve their own contributions
- Query knowledge quality metrics to prioritize reliable information sources

### Recursive Value
**What new scenarios become possible after this exists?**
1. **Knowledge Curator Agent** - Automated knowledge pruning, merging, and quality improvement
2. **Semantic Research Assistant** - Deep exploration of concept relationships and evolution
3. **Knowledge Drift Detector** - Monitors for outdated or contradictory information
4. **Intelligence Metrics Dashboard** - Track Vrooli's overall intelligence growth over time
5. **Knowledge Lineage Tracer** - Track origin and evolution of specific concepts

## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Design Decisions
**Real-time vs Batch Processing**: Chose real-time metrics calculation for immediate feedback
- Alternative considered: Batch processing every hour
- Decision driver: Users need immediate knowledge health visibility
- Trade-offs: Higher CPU usage for better responsiveness

### Known Limitations
- **Large Graph Rendering**: Limited to 1000 nodes for performance
  - Workaround: Use filtering and pagination
  - Future fix: Implement WebGL-based rendering

### Security Considerations
- **Data Protection**: Read-only access to Qdrant by default
- **Access Control**: API key required for management operations
- **Audit Trail**: All queries logged with timestamp and user
