# Silent Founder OS - Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is Silent Founder OS?

Silent Founder OS is a subscription bundle of desktop applications designed for solopreneurs, freelancers, and small teams. The suite provides capabilities that typically require dedicated hires—automation, testing, and marketing—in a unified, locally-run package.

The name reflects the philosophy: build a full business without needing to talk to anyone. No sales calls, no team meetings, no social overhead.

### What is Vrooli Ascension?

Vrooli Ascension is the first app in the Silent Founder OS bundle. It's a desktop application with a built-in browser that captures everything you do as a timeline. You can then select any range of actions and turn them into:

- **Reusable automations** that run on demand or on a schedule
- **End-to-end tests** with assertions and evidence collection
- **Polished replays** for demos, onboarding, and marketing

The core idea: work normally, automate retroactively.

### How is this different from Playwright, Selenium, or Cypress?

| Aspect | Traditional Tools | Vrooli Ascension |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Setup** | Write code first | Record first, edit later |
| **Learning curve** | Learn a testing framework | Browse normally |
| **Maintenance** | Fix broken selectors in code | Visual timeline editing |
| **Marketing output** | None (testing only) | Export styled replays as video |
| **Target user** | QA engineers and developers | Anyone who uses a browser |

Traditional tools are code-first: you write test scripts, run them headless, and debug failures. Vrooli Ascension is action-first: you browse normally, and the system captures everything. Then you decide what to automate.

For teams already invested in Playwright or Selenium, Vrooli Ascension can complement those tools for visual QA review and demo generation.

### Do I need coding experience?

No. Vrooli Ascension captures your browser actions automatically. Creating a workflow is as simple as:

1. Browse inside the app
2. Select the actions you want to reuse
3. Save as a workflow

For advanced users, the app supports JavaScript expressions, conditional logic, and loop constructs. But basic automation and testing require no code.

### Can I use this for production testing?

Yes. Workflows support:

- **Assertions** (check element existence, text content, attributes)
- **Screenshot evidence** at every step
- **Console and network log capture**
- **Retry logic and backoff policies**
- **CLI and API access** for CI/CD integration

You can run tests on schedule, export results programmatically, and integrate with your existing pipelines.

## Privacy and Security

### Is my data collected?

No. Vrooli Ascension runs entirely on your local machine. Your browser data, recordings, workflows, screenshots, and logs stay on your computer unless you explicitly export them.

There is no telemetry, no analytics, and no cloud sync. We don't see what you automate.

### What does open-source mean for me?

The full source code is available under the GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPL v3):

- **Transparency:** You can audit exactly what the software does
- **Community:** You can contribute improvements or report issues
- **Freedom:** You can fork and modify for your own use (under license terms)

The license is available at [github.com/Vrooli/Vrooli/blob/master/LICENSE](https://github.com/Vrooli/Vrooli/blob/master/LICENSE).

## Platform and Technical

### What operating systems are supported?

- **Linux** (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, and most distributions)
- **macOS** (Intel and Apple Silicon, macOS 11+)
- **Windows** (Windows 10 and Windows 11)

All platforms have full feature parity. The app bundles its own Chromium-based browser.

### Does it work offline?

Yes. Vrooli Ascension runs locally and does not require an internet connection for core functionality. You only need internet access when:

- Browsing websites (obviously)
- Downloading updates
- Validating your subscription (periodic, not continuous)
