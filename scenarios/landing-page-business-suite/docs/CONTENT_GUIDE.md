## Core Principles

### 1. Focus on Benefits, Not Features

**Features** describe what your product does.
**Benefits** describe what your customer gains.

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| "AI-powered analysis" | "Make decisions 10x faster" |
| "256-bit encryption" | "Your data is bank-level secure" |
| "24/7 monitoring" | "Sleep well knowing we've got you covered" |

### 2. Write for Your Reader, Not Yourself

Ask yourself:
- What problem keeps them up at night?
- What outcome do they desperately want?
- What objections might stop them from buying?

### 3. Be Specific, Not Vague

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Save time" | "Save 5 hours every week" |
| "Affordable pricing" | "Starting at $29/month" |
| "Fast results" | "See results in 24 hours" |

### 4. Use Clear, Simple Language

- Write at an 8th-grade reading level
- Avoid jargon unless your audience expects it
- Short sentences beat long ones
- One idea per paragraph

---

## Writing by Section

### Hero Section

The hero is your one chance to hook visitors. You have about 3 seconds.

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                        HERO SECTION                          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                             |
|  HEADLINE (5-10 words)                                      |
|  -------------------                                        |
|  State the main benefit or solve the main problem           |
|                                                             |
|  SUBHEADLINE (15-25 words)                                  |
|  -------------------------                                  |
|  Expand on the headline, add context or credibility         |
|                                                             |
|  CTA BUTTON (2-4 words)                                     |
|  --------------------                                       |
|  Clear action the visitor should take                       |
|                                                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Headline Formula Options:**

1. **Problem -> Solution**: "Stop wasting hours on [problem]"
2. **Outcome**: "[Achieve X] without [pain point]"
3. **Question**: "What if you could [desired outcome]?"
4. **Statement**: "The [adjective] way to [do something]"

**Example Headlines:**

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "Welcome to Our Platform" | "Launch Your SaaS in 60 Seconds" |
| "Next-Generation Solution" | "Cut Your Dev Time by 80%" |
| "Innovative Technology" | "Build Landing Pages That Actually Convert" |

### Features Section

Show visitors what they get and why it matters.

**Feature Writing Template:**

```
[Icon]
[Feature Name] (2-4 words)
[Benefit statement] (8-15 words)
```

**Examples:**

```
* Instant Setup
Go from idea to live landing page in under 5 minutes.

* A/B Testing Built-In
Test variants automatically and let data pick the winner.

* Payments Included
Accept credit cards with zero additional configuration.
```

**Tips:**
- Lead with the benefit, not the feature name
- Use action verbs ("Launch", "Track", "Automate")
- Include numbers when possible ("5x faster", "in 3 clicks")

### Pricing Section

Pricing affects both conversion and revenue. Be strategic.

**Title Options:**
- "Simple, Transparent Pricing"
- "Choose Your Plan"
- "Pricing That Scales With You"

**Per Tier:**
- **Name**: Should indicate value level (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
- **Price**: Be clear about billing frequency
- **Features**: Lead with the most valuable, limit to 5-7
- **CTA**: Match to the tier ("Start Free", "Go Pro", "Contact Sales")

**Pricing Psychology:**
- Anchor with a high-priced option
- Highlight the plan you want people to choose
- Show annual pricing with monthly equivalent ("$290/year = $24/mo")

### Testimonials Section

Social proof reduces buying anxiety.

**What makes a good testimonial:**
- Specific results ("increased conversions by 47%")
- Overcomes objections ("I was skeptical at first, but...")
- Relatable person (name, title, photo, company)

**Template:**

```
"[Specific result or transformation]. [How it solved their problem].
[Would recommend or emotional reaction]."

-- [Name], [Title] at [Company]
```

**Example:**

```
"We launched our landing page in 20 minutes and had our first
paying customer that same day. I've tried other builders and
nothing comes close to this speed."

-- Sarah Chen, Founder at GrowthLab
```

**Tips:**
- Real photos > stock photos
- Specific > vague
- 3-5 testimonials is optimal
- Mix of different personas if possible

### FAQ Section

FAQs handle objections and reduce support burden.

**Questions to include:**

1. **Purchase concerns**: "What if it doesn't work for me?"
2. **Technical concerns**: "Do I need coding skills?"
3. **Pricing concerns**: "Are there hidden fees?"
4. **Support concerns**: "How do I get help?"
5. **Trust concerns**: "How secure is my data?"

**Answer Structure:**
- Start with the direct answer
- Then explain if needed
- Keep under 50 words per answer

**Example:**

```
Q: Can I cancel anytime?

A: Yes, cancel with one click from your account settings.
No questions asked, no fees. Your access continues until
the end of your billing period.
```

### CTA Section

Your final push to convert. Creates urgency and removes friction.

**Headline Formulas:**
- "Ready to [achieve outcome]?"
- "Start [doing benefit] today"
- "Join [number] others who [achieved outcome]"

**Support Elements:**
- Risk reducer: "30-day money-back guarantee"
- Social proof: "Trusted by 10,000+ users"
- Urgency (if genuine): "Price increases next month"

### Footer

Often overlooked but important for trust and SEO.

**Must-have links:**
- Privacy Policy
- Terms of Service
- Contact information

**Good-to-have:**
- Social media links
- Company/About link
- Support/Help link

## Headlines That Hook

### The 4 U's Framework

Your headline should be:
- **Useful**: Provides clear benefit
- **Urgent**: Creates reason to act now
- **Unique**: Stands out from competitors
- **Ultra-specific**: Uses concrete details

### Power Words

Use these to add impact:

| Category | Words |
|----------|-------|
| **Urgency** | Now, Today, Instant, Fast, Quick |
| **Value** | Free, Save, Bonus, Exclusive |
| **Trust** | Proven, Guaranteed, Secure, Trusted |
| **Ease** | Simple, Easy, Effortless, Automatic |
| **Results** | Transform, Boost, Grow, Increase |

### Headline Templates

Copy and customize:

```
1. "The [Fastest/Easiest/Only] Way to [Desired Outcome]"

2. "[Number] [People/Companies] Use [Product] to [Benefit]"

3. "Stop [Pain Point]. Start [Desired Outcome]."

4. "What If You Could [Achieve X] in [Timeframe]?"

5. "[Do X] Without [Common Pain Point]"

6. "Finally, a [Product Type] That [Key Differentiator]"
```

## CTAs That Convert

### Button Text Best Practices

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Submit" | "Get My Free Guide" |
| "Click Here" | "Start Building Now" |
| "Learn More" | "See How It Works" |
| "Buy Now" | "Start My Free Trial" |

### CTA Formula

```
[Action Verb] + [Value/Outcome] + [Optional: Timeframe]
```

**Examples:**
- "Start Building Today"
- "Get Instant Access"
- "Claim Your Free Trial"
- "See Results in 24 Hours"

### Reducing Friction

Add supporting text below the button:
- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- "Free for 14 days"
- "Setup takes 2 minutes"

## Common Mistakes

### 1. "We" Focus Instead of "You" Focus

```
X "We built the most advanced platform..."
* "You'll build landing pages 10x faster..."
```

### 2. Feature Dumping

```
X List of 20 features with no context
* Top 3-5 features with clear benefits
```

### 3. Vague Claims

```
X "Best-in-class solution"
* "Rated #1 by 500+ G2 reviewers"
```

### 4. Buried CTA

```
X CTA only at the bottom of the page
* CTA visible above the fold + repeated throughout
```

### 5. Clever Over Clear

```
X "Revolutionize your paradigm"
* "Build your landing page in 5 minutes"
```

### 6. Missing Social Proof

```
X "Trust us, it works!"
* "Join 10,000+ customers including..."
```
