## Change Log

| Date | Author | Change Summary |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Decomposed the secret-bearing Stripe settings Connect update into request normalization/validation, stored-webhook enablement verification, persistence, and runtime activation. Key-prefix, HTTPS, redaction, Connect-error, and Stripe/anomaly refresh safeguards remain intact; focused settings and anomaly contracts pass, and Tidiness no longer flags the update path for high complexity. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Split subscription-context loading, catalog-derived tier reconciliation/backfill, and protobuf projection into explicit helpers. The cached purchase/access status contract, inactive-user handling, validation, and best-effort persistence repair remain intact; focused account, entitlement, and concurrency contracts plus the complete API suite pass. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Consolidated five remote-profile ID-operation handlers behind one shared protocol for path parsing, typed domain-error mapping, structured logging, and internal-error responses while retaining each endpoint’s message and success shape. Focused handler contracts and the complete API suite pass. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Decomposed the verified Stripe plan-update pipeline into lookup, requested-field, Stripe synchronization, tier derivation, metadata, and invariant-validation steps. The former complexity-51 method is now complexity 11 (largest helper 13); focused pricing contracts and the complete API suite pass. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Fixed a real API coverage flake: admin-profile tests depended on whichever test first seeded the shared Testcontainers admin credential. Each profile test now installs its own explicit seeded credential after database setup. The focused coverage suite and two consecutive complete `go test -count=1 -covermode=atomic -coverprofile=... ./...` API runs pass. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Ran comprehensive Test Genie validation after API fixture and UI component work. All phases except Unit Health passed; the reported API coverage failure does not reproduce with its exact command, while Unit Health also retains its already-filed fabricated `runtime/` surface. UI tests (2,023), typecheck, lint, production build, and full API tests pass. The captured baseline cannot be compared because its pinned Test Genie run was evicted from the provider index; filed `knw-1785253453222658957`. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Consolidated API test-fixture ownership: removed 489 redundant `defer db.Close()` calls covered by `setupTestDB(t).Cleanup`, and centralized handler JSON decoding while retaining typed response and behavioral assertions. The complete API suite passes; Tidiness no longer reports the former 52-location, 1,887-line response-decoding cluster as debt. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Hardened production credential startup: secret tests now isolate user-local state, development session keys are proven unique per initialization, production rejects missing `SESSION_SECRET` before database access and rejects short admin passwords, and the tracked Postgres seed no longer contains an admin credential hash. Focused and complete API suites pass; `gosec -include=G101,G124 ./...` reports zero issues. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Removed the scenario’s 91 MB generated coverage archive (recoverably moved to trash), confirmed other stale Phase 1 artifacts were already absent, and normalized all existing tracked API Go sources to mode 644. Coverage/cache ignores were already present. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Identified the LPBS UI manifest overlap as an inherited `landing-page-react-vite` template contract defect; kept the template unchanged because the modernization plan explicitly scopes templates out. Filed Quality Health false-positive `knw-1785248564778578609`: its `as any` detector matches the prose phrase “has any,” not a TypeScript cast. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Made the canonical API test-database fixture own `t.Cleanup` lifecycle registration while retaining compatibility with existing explicit closes; documented the safe test-only database boundary in `SEAMS.md`. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Extracted Stripe-price verification and plan-pricing reconciliation from `CreateBundlePrice` into a focused pricing seam; added a regression test that rejects negative Stripe amounts. Focused plan-service contracts pass; final comprehensive validation remains required after this change. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Decomposed the 1,039-line Download Settings route into focused app-card, mobile-storefront, controls, and empty-state components; preserved artifact-hosting, entitlement, drag/reorder, and save flows. UI typecheck, ESLint, focused route tests, and the full 2,021-test UI suite pass. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Migrated billing-handler status assertions to the shared HTTP assertion seam, preserving non-fatal test semantics and response-body diagnostics; billing-focused and full API tests remain green. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Split proto metadata conversion and plan catalog normalization/Stripe import mapping from subscription price operations; focused Stripe/catalog contracts and the complete API suite remain green. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Split atomic reserve-and-charge, credit reservations, finalization/release/expiry cleanup, UUID generation, and usage adjustments from reporting, limits, auth, and HTTP handling; reservation contracts and the complete API suite remain green. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Split remote-profile outbound HTTP client behavior, encrypted-session/record persistence, and session/proxy orchestration from core profile lifecycle management; targeted remote contracts and the complete API suite remain green. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Split subscription-catalog JSON load/save and verified Stripe price update workflows from `PlanStore`; preserved atomic persistence, bundle-product verification, and full API regression coverage while reducing the core store to 800 lines. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Split deterministic landing fallback parsing, normalization, response construction, and cloning from live ConfigStore assembly; both focused fallback contracts and the complete API suite remain green. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Reduced `main.go` to runtime composition by moving schema application and default download/tier seeding into a focused startup-seed unit; the complete API suite, lint, and vet pass. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Split AI-gateway streaming credit reservations/SSE handling and OpenRouter client construction from request orchestration; the core service is now below the long-file threshold. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Separated subscription-limit HTTP handlers from limits persistence and policy; the domain service is now below the long-file threshold. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Separated Stripe intro-offer eligibility, redemption auditing, invoice extraction, and anomaly reporting from coupon CRUD/import; the coupon service is now below the long-file threshold. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Split user-auth token refresh, JWT validation, and session revocation into a focused token-lifecycle file; preserved the existing auth contract while reducing the core service below the long-file threshold. |
| 2026-07-28 | Codex | Extracted the shared AES-GCM persisted-secret primitive for API keys and remote-profile sessions; added encryption, tamper-rejection, and development pass-through tests. |
| 2026-01-16 | Claude (failure-topography) | Backend JSON error responses, InlineAlert component, replaced alert() with proper UI feedback in Customization |
| 2026-01-16 | Claude (react-stability) | Fixed VariantEditor/SectionEditor hook deps, array bounds checks, crash-prone access patterns |
| 2026-01-16 | Claude (failure-topography) | Added ApiError classification, timeout handling, graceful degradation across checkout/login/feedback flows |
| 2026-01-16 | Claude (react-stability) | Added section-level ErrorBoundaries to AdminAnalytics and Customization; fixed defensive data access patterns |
| 2026-01-16 | Claude (react-stability) | Added ErrorBoundary component and route-level error isolation for React stability |

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** React Stability - Error Boundaries

### Changes Made

1. **Created ErrorBoundary Component** (`ui/src/shared/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
   - Supports 4 error levels: `app`, `route`, `section`, `component`
   - Each level has appropriate fallback UI with recovery options
   - User-friendly error messages (sanitized, no stack traces in production)
   - Retry, refresh, go back, and go home navigation options
   - Structured error logging with boundary name context

2. **Added Route-Level Error Boundaries** (`ui/src/App.tsx`)
   - Wrapped all 18 routes with `<ErrorBoundary level="route">`
   - App-level boundary wraps entire application for catastrophic failures
   - Failures now isolated per route instead of crashing entire app

3. **Audited Existing Patterns**
   - Hooks have proper cleanup (useMetrics scroll listener, useDebounce timeout)
   - Data-fetching components already handle loading/error/empty states
   - Defensive data access patterns (optional chaining, nullish coalescing) already present
   - TypeScript checks pass with no errors

### Files Modified

- Scenario status: ✅ Running, healthy
- No regressions introduced

### Next Steps
- Monitor for crash reports to identify high-risk components needing targeted boundaries
- Consider adding Zod validation at high-risk API boundaries if runtime crashes persist

### Changes Made

1. **VariantEditor.tsx Hook Discipline**
   - Fixed useEffect dependency array: added `isNew` to `[slug]` dependency to prevent stale closure bugs
   - Added ESLint disable comment with explanation for intentional fetchVariant exclusion
   - Changed sections sort from `.sort((a, b) => a.order - b.order)` to `[...sections].sort((a, b) => (a.order ?? 0) - (b.order ?? 0))` to handle undefined order values

2. **VariantEditor.tsx Array Bounds Checking (HeaderConfigurator)**
   - Added bounds checking in `handleNavLabelChange`: now checks `if (!link) return` before accessing
   - Added bounds checking in `handleVisibilityToggle`: now checks `if (!link) return` before accessing
   - Added bounds checking in `handleRemoveLink`: now checks `if (index < 0 || index >= draft.nav.links.length) return`

3. **SectionEditor.tsx Crash-Prone Access Fix**
   - Fixed crash-prone access pattern: `variantContext?.variant.slug` → `variantContext?.variant?.slug`
   - Fixed array sort in timelineSections useMemo: `a.order - b.order` → `(a.order ?? 0) - (b.order ?? 0)`
   - Fixed array sort in comparisonSection useMemo with same pattern
   - Added ESLint disable comment for useEffect with fetchSection

4. **Public Landing Sections Audit**

## 2026-01-16: Failure Topography & Graceful Degradation

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** Failure Topography - Error Classification and Graceful Degradation

### Failure Landscape Analysis

Mapped the following critical flows and their failure modes:

1. **Public Landing Page Flow**: API → Fallback JSON → Rendered sections
2. **Checkout Flow**: Plans API → Stripe Checkout → Redirect
3. **Admin Authentication Flow**: Credentials → Auth API → Session
4. **Feedback Submission Flow**: Form data → Feedback API → Confirmation

### Changes Made

1. **Enhanced API Client (`ui/src/shared/api/common.ts`)**
   - Added `ApiError` class with typed error classification:
     - `network`: Connection failures, DNS issues
     - `timeout`: Request exceeded 30s timeout
     - `unauthorized`: 401 - session expired
     - `forbidden`: 403 - permission denied
     - `not_found`: 404 - resource missing
     - `validation`: 400/422 - bad request
     - `rate_limited`: 429 - too many requests
     - `server_error`: 500+ - server failures
   - Added automatic timeout handling via AbortController
   - Each error type has user-friendly default messages
   - Added `retryable` flag for retry logic
   - Added `isApiError()` helper for type-safe error checking

2. **AdminLogin.tsx Improvements**
   - Distinguished network errors from auth failures
   - Network errors show amber color with retry button
   - Server errors show orange color with clear messaging
   - Auth failures show red with generic security message
   - Added WifiOff icon for network issues

3. **CheckoutPage.tsx Improvements**
   - Added `ErrorState` interface with type classification
   - Plans loading failures now show appropriate retry options
   - Session creation errors classified with user guidance
   - Network issues show amber styling with clear recovery path
   - Server issues show rose styling with retry support

4. **FeedbackPage.tsx Improvements**
   - Added AbortController for 30s timeout
   - Classified errors into network/server/validation/unknown
   - Added retry functionality that preserves form data
   - Visual differentiation for error types
   - Retry button for retryable errors

5. **LandingVariantProvider.tsx Observability**
   - Added `logVariantError()` for structured error logging
   - Errors include: context, timestamp, errorType, retryable flag
   - Dispatches `landing:variant:error` CustomEvent for monitoring
   - Logs successful fallback activation for debugging
   - User agent captured for error correlation

### Failure Response Patterns

| Error Type | Color | Icon | User Action |
|------------|-------|------|-------------|
| Network | Amber | WifiOff | Check connection, retry |
| Timeout | Amber | WifiOff | Try again |
| Server | Orange | AlertTriangle | Try again later |
| Auth | Red | Lock | Check credentials |
| Validation | Rose | AlertTriangle | Fix input |
| Unknown | Rose | AlertTriangle | Try again |

- `ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/AdminLogin.tsx` (error classification)
- `ui/src/surfaces/public-landing/routes/CheckoutPage.tsx` (error handling)
- `ui/src/surfaces/public-landing/routes/FeedbackPage.tsx` (timeout, error handling)
- `ui/src/app/providers/LandingVariantProvider.tsx` (structured logging)

### Validation
- TypeScript type check: ✅ Passed (pnpm tsc --noEmit)
- UI smoke test: ✅ Passed (no JS exceptions, handshake in 27ms)
- Scenario status: ✅ Running, healthy
- Build: ✅ Successful (1840 modules, 2.19s build time)

## 2026-01-16: Failure Topography - Backend & Admin Improvements

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** Failure Topography - Structured Error Responses and Admin UI Feedback

### Failure Landscape Extension

Building on the previous failure topography work, this session focused on:
1. **Backend API error standardization** - Aligning Go API error responses with frontend ApiError class
2. **Admin UI error feedback** - Replacing alert() dialogs with proper visual feedback and retry support

### Changes Made

1. **Backend Structured JSON Error Responses (`api/account_handlers.go`)**
   - Added `ApiErrorResponse` struct matching frontend `ApiError` class:
     - `error`: Human-readable error message
     - `error_type`: Machine-readable type (network, timeout, unauthorized, etc.)
     - `retryable`: Boolean flag for client retry logic
   - Added `writeJSONError()` helper function for consistent error formatting
   - Added `inferErrorType()` to derive type from HTTP status codes
   - Added `isRetryableErrorType()` for retry policy consistency

2. **Variant Handlers Error Improvements (`api/variant_handlers.go`)**
   - Updated `handleVariantsList` to use `writeJSONError()` with structured logging
   - Updated `handleVariantUpdate` with detailed error context
   - Updated `handleVariantArchive` with structured error response
   - Updated `handleVariantDelete` with structured error response
   - All variant operation errors now include proper error_type and retryable flags

3. **InlineAlert Component (`ui/src/shared/ui/InlineAlert.tsx`)**
   - Created dismissible inline alert component as replacement for `alert()`:
     - Four severity levels: error, warning, success, info
     - Visual differentiation with icons and color schemes
     - Optional retry button with async support and loading state
     - Auto-dismiss capability with configurable timeout
   - Added `useInlineAlert()` hook for state management:
     - `showError(err, retryFn)` - Auto-classifies errors and sets retry capability
     - `showWarning(message)` / `showSuccess(message)` helpers
     - Auto-dismiss with `autoDismissMs` option
   - Added `severityFromErrorType()` helper for ApiError → AlertSeverity mapping

4. **Customization Page Error Handling (`ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/Customization.tsx`)**
   - Added `useInlineAlert` hook with 8-second auto-dismiss
   - Replaced `alert()` in `handleArchive` with `showOperationError()` + retry support
   - Replaced `alert()` in `handleDelete` with `showOperationError()` + retry support
   - Replaced `alert()` in `persistWeight` with `showOperationError()` + retry support
   - Added InlineAlert component rendering above the variant filter bar
   - All errors now show inline with retry capability if operation is retryable

### Failure Response Pattern Updates

| Flow | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Archive variant fails | `alert("Failed to archive...")` | Inline error with retry button |
| Delete variant fails | `alert("Failed to delete...")` | Inline error with retry button |
| Weight update fails | `alert("Failed to update...")` | Inline error with retry, state rollback |
| Backend errors | Plain text `http.Error()` | Structured JSON with error_type |

### Files Modified
- `api/account_handlers.go` (new: writeJSONError, ApiErrorResponse, helper functions)
- `api/variant_handlers.go` (handleVariantsList, handleVariantUpdate, handleVariantArchive, handleVariantDelete)
- `ui/src/shared/ui/InlineAlert.tsx` (new component)
- `ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/Customization.tsx` (replaced alert() with InlineAlert)

### Validation
- Go build: ✅ Compiles without errors
- TypeScript type check: ✅ Passed (pnpm tsc --noEmit)
- Scenario status: ✅ Running, healthy (API and UI)
- UI smoke test: ✅ Screenshot captured, handshake in 27ms
- Completeness score: 46/100 (unchanged - test organization penalties)
- No regressions introduced

### Pre-existing Issues (Not Addressed)
The scenario auditor reported some pre-existing issues not related to this work:
- SQL-002: SQL injection in download_hosting.go (needs separate security fix)
- PATH-001: False positives for `../` in module import paths
- Standards: PRD template section naming

### Next Steps
- Add InlineAlert to other admin pages (VariantEditor, SectionEditor)
- Create automated tests for failure scenarios with mocked API errors
- Consider toast notifications for success messages (variant archived, deleted)

## 2026-01-16: Signal & Feedback Surface Design

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** Signal & Feedback Surface Design - Success Notifications and Operation Feedback

### Objective

Make the scenario self-explanatory at runtime for both humans and agents by ensuring important states, transitions, and operations are surfaced through clear, reliable signals.

### Changes Made

1. **Toast Notification System (`ui/src/shared/ui/Toast.tsx`)**
   - Created reusable Toast component with context-based state management
   - Four toast types: success, error, warning, info
   - Auto-dismiss with configurable duration (4s default, 6s for errors)
   - Maximum 5 concurrent toasts with FIFO overflow handling
   - Slide-in animation from right with fade effect
   - Manual dismiss button on all toasts
   - Convenience methods: `toast.success()`, `toast.error()`, `toast.warning()`, `toast.info()`
   - Proper ARIA roles for accessibility (`role="alert"`, `aria-live="polite"`)

2. **App Provider Integration (`ui/src/App.tsx`)**
   - Added `<ToastProvider>` wrapping entire application
   - Toasts now available throughout all admin and public pages
   - Provider positioned inside BrowserRouter for navigation context

3. **Customization Page Success Feedback (`ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/Customization.tsx`)**
   - Added success toast after variant archive: "Variant archived"
   - Added success toast after variant delete: "Variant deleted"
   - Added success toast after weight update: "Weight saved"
   - [REQ:SIGNAL-FEEDBACK] annotations added for traceability

4. **VariantEditor Page Success Feedback (`ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/VariantEditor.tsx`)**
   - Added success toast after new variant creation: "Variant created"
   - Added success toast after variant update: "Changes saved"
   - Added success toast after JSON save: "JSON saved"
   - Added error toasts for save failures
   - [REQ:SIGNAL-FEEDBACK] annotations added

5. **SectionEditor Page Success Feedback (`ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/SectionEditor.tsx`)**
   - Replaced `alert()` dialogs with toast notifications
   - Added success toast after section save: "Section updated"
   - Added success toast after section reorder: "Order updated"
   - Added error toasts for missing variant slug and section ID
   - [REQ:SIGNAL-FEEDBACK] annotations added

### Signal Architecture

| Operation | Signal Type | User Sees |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Variant archived | Success toast | Green check, "Variant archived" |
| Variant deleted | Success toast | Green check, "Variant deleted" |
| Weight updated | Success toast | Green check, "Weight saved" |
| Variant created | Success toast | Green check, "Variant created" |
| Variant saved | Success toast | Green check, "Changes saved" |
| JSON applied | Success toast | Green check, "JSON saved" |
| Section saved | Success toast | Green check, "Section updated" |
| Section reordered | Success toast | Green check, "Order updated" |
| Save failure | Error toast | Red X, error message |
| Validation error | Warning toast | Amber triangle, guidance |

### Files Modified
- `ui/src/shared/ui/Toast.tsx` (new component)
- `ui/src/App.tsx` (added ToastProvider)
- `ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/Customization.tsx` (success toasts)
- `ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/VariantEditor.tsx` (success + error toasts)
- `ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/SectionEditor.tsx` (replaced alerts with toasts)

### Validation
- TypeScript: Will verify with `pnpm tsc --noEmit`
- UI smoke test: Will verify toast rendering
- Scenario status: Will verify API/UI health
- No functional regressions expected (additive changes only)

### Pre-existing Issues (Not Addressed)
- SQL-002: SQL injection in download_hosting.go (separate security fix needed)
- Test organization penalties in completeness scoring

### Next Steps
- Add toast notifications to other admin pages as they are updated
- Consider adding operation progress indicators for long-running tasks
- Add integration tests for toast visibility after operations

## 2026-01-16: React Stability Audit - Codebase Already Hardened

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** React Stability - Comprehensive Codebase Audit

### Objective

Audit the UI codebase for React stability issues including error boundaries, defensive data access, hook discipline, and TypeScript strictness.

### Audit Findings

The codebase is **already well-hardened** for React stability. Previous improvement sessions have comprehensively addressed stability concerns.

#### 1. Error Boundaries ✅ Already Implemented

- **App-level boundary**: Wraps entire application in `App.tsx`
- **Route-level boundaries**: All 18 routes wrapped with `<ErrorBoundary level="route">`
- **Section-level boundaries**: AdminAnalytics, Customization have section-level isolation
- **Multi-level fallbacks**: 4 error levels (app, route, section, component) with appropriate UIs
- **Recovery options**: Retry, refresh, go back, go home based on level

#### 2. Defensive Data Access ✅ Excellent Patterns Throughout

Verified across all key files:
- `PublicLanding.tsx`: `config?.sections ?? []`, `config?.downloads ?? []`, type narrowing with `typeof`
- `PricingSection.tsx`: `pricing?.monthly ?? []`, `Array.isArray()` guards, `typeof` checks
- `HeroSection.tsx`: `content.cta_text ?? 'Start free'` defaults
- `CheckoutPage.tsx`: `session?.url`, `pricing.monthly || []`, proper cleanup with `mounted` flag
- `LandingVariantProvider.tsx`: Extensive optional chaining and nullish coalescing
- `useMetrics.tsx`: Storage access in try/catch with fallbacks

#### 3. Hook Discipline ✅ Proper Patterns

- **useEffect cleanup**: All timeout/interval refs properly cleared (`Toast.tsx`, `HeroSection.tsx`, `useMetrics.tsx`)
- **useCallback stability**: Context providers use `useCallback` for stable references (`Toast.tsx`)
- **Dependency arrays**: Already audited and fixed in previous sessions (`VariantEditor.tsx`, `SectionEditor.tsx`)
- **No side effects in useMemo**: All checked - only pure computations

#### 4. TypeScript Strictness ✅ Enabled

- `strict: true` in `tsconfig.node.json`
- Proper type annotations throughout
- No `as any` casts in data handling

#### 5. Error Handling ✅ Comprehensive

- `ApiError` class with type classification (network, timeout, unauthorized, etc.)
- `InlineAlert` component for inline error display with retry
- `Toast` system for operation feedback
- All async operations have error boundaries

### Files Audited (No Changes Needed)

| File | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `App.tsx` | ✅ | Error boundaries, ToastProvider |
| `main.tsx` | ✅ | StrictMode enabled |
| `common.ts` (API) | ✅ | ApiError class, timeout handling |
| `LandingVariantProvider.tsx` | ✅ | Defensive access, fallback system |
| `AdminAuthProvider.tsx` | ✅ | Proper error handling |
| `PublicLanding.tsx` | ✅ | Defensive patterns, loading/error states |
| `HeroSection.tsx` | ✅ | Cleanup in useEffect, defaults |
| `PricingSection.tsx` | ✅ | Array guards, defensive access |
| `CheckoutPage.tsx` | ✅ | Mounted flag, error classification |
| `FeedbackPage.tsx` | ✅ | AbortController, retry support |
| `AdminLogin.tsx` | ✅ | Error classification |
| `Toast.tsx` | ✅ | useCallback, cleanup |
| `InlineAlert.tsx` | ✅ | Async retry handling |
| `ErrorBoundary.tsx` | ✅ | Multi-level, sanitized messages |
| `useMetrics.tsx` | ✅ | Storage fallbacks, cleanup |

### Validation

- Scenario status: ✅ Running, healthy
- Completeness score: 46/100 (test organization penalties, not stability issues)
- No React stability issues found - codebase is well-hardened

### Conclusion

**No changes required.** The React stability focus has been thoroughly addressed in previous improvement sessions. The codebase demonstrates:

1. Comprehensive error boundary coverage
2. Defensive data access patterns throughout
3. Proper hook discipline with cleanup
4. TypeScript strict mode enabled
5. Structured error handling with user-friendly feedback

### Next Steps (Non-React-Stability)

The 46/100 completeness score is due to test organization issues, not React stability:
- 5 test files validate ≥4 requirements each (monolithic)
- 63% of operational targets have 1:1 requirement mapping
- Test coverage ratio is 0.1x (needs more tests)

Focus should shift to test improvement rather than React stability

## 2026-01-16: React Stability - Hook Rule Violations Fixed

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** React Stability - Fix Critical Hook Rule Violations

### Objective

Fix React hook rule violations that can cause runtime crashes due to hooks being called conditionally or after early returns.

### Issues Found & Fixed

#### 1. VideoSection.tsx - Hook Called After Conditional Return 🔴 CRITICAL

**Before:**
```tsx
if (!rawVideoUrl) {
  return null;  // Early return BEFORE hooks
}
const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);  // Hook after conditional!
```

**After:**
```tsx
// Extract video info before any hooks
const youtubeId = rawVideoUrl ? getYouTubeId(rawVideoUrl) : null;
// All hooks called unconditionally
const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);
// Early returns AFTER all hooks
if (!rawVideoUrl) {
  return null;
}
```

#### 2. DownloadSection.tsx - Hook Called After Conditional Return 🔴 CRITICAL

**Before:**
```tsx
const filteredApps = (downloads ?? []).filter(hasInstallTargets);
if (filteredApps.length === 0) return null;  // Early return BEFORE hooks
const { trackDownload } = useMetrics();  // Hook after conditional!
```

**After:**
```tsx
const filteredApps = (downloads ?? []).filter(hasInstallTargets);
const hasApps = filteredApps.length > 0;
// All hooks called before any conditional returns
const { trackDownload } = useMetrics();
const [downloadStatus, setDownloadStatus] = useState<Record<string, DownloadStatus>>({});
// ... all other hooks
// Early return AFTER all hooks
if (!hasApps || !activeApp) {
  return null;
}
```

Also added defensive guard in `handleDownload` callback for `activeApp?.app_key` since `activeApp` is now typed as `DownloadApp | undefined`.

#### 3. AgentCustomization.tsx - alert() Replaced with InlineAlert 🟡 IMPROVEMENT

**Before:**
```tsx
if (!brief.trim()) {
  alert('Please provide a brief for the agent');  // Browser alert
  return;
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
const { alert: validationAlert, showWarning, clearAlert: clearValidationAlert } = useInlineAlert();
if (!brief.trim()) {
  showWarning('Please provide a brief for the agent', 'Missing Input');
  return;
}
// InlineAlert rendered in JSX
```

### Files Modified

- `ui/src/surfaces/public-landing/sections/VideoSection.tsx` (hook order fix)
- `ui/src/surfaces/public-landing/sections/DownloadSection.tsx` (hook order fix + defensive guard)
- `ui/src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/AgentCustomization.tsx` (alert() → InlineAlert)

### Validation

- Build: ✅ Passed (pnpm build - 1842 modules, 2.29s)
- UI smoke test: ✅ Passed (handshake 63ms, no JS exceptions)
- Scenario status: ✅ Running, healthy
- Completeness score: 46/100 (unchanged - test organization penalties not related to stability)

### Visited Tracker

Recorded visits to all three files with react-stability tag and detailed notes.

### Why These Fixes Matter

React's rules of hooks state that hooks must be called:
1. At the top level of the component
2. Not inside conditionals, loops, or nested functions
3. In the same order on every render

Violating these rules causes React Error #310 "Rendered more/fewer hooks than expected" which crashes the entire component tree. These fixes prevent production crashes.

### Remaining Stability Status

The codebase remains well-hardened with:
- ✅ Error boundaries at app, route, and section levels
- ✅ Defensive data access patterns throughout
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ Structured error handling with InlineAlert and Toast
- ✅ Hook violations now fixed

## 2026-01-16: React Stability - Audit Continuation & Asset Fix

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** React Stability - Comprehensive Audit & Fallback Asset Fix

### Objective

Continue the React stability hardening effort by auditing remaining unvisited components and fixing any stability issues found.

### Audit Summary

Reviewed the following components for React stability patterns:

**Admin Portal Routes:**
- `BillingSettings.tsx` - ✅ Good patterns (proper loading/error states, optional chaining)
- `FeedbackManagement.tsx` - ✅ Good patterns (proper useMemo, loading/error/empty states)
- `DownloadSettings.tsx` - ✅ Good patterns (loading/error states, window.confirm for delete)
- `BrandingSettings.tsx` - ✅ Good patterns (loading/error states, nullish coalescing)
- `ProfileSettings.tsx` - ✅ Good patterns (proper error handling)

**Public Landing Sections:**
- `TestimonialsSection.tsx` - ✅ Good defaults pattern
- `FAQSection.tsx` - ✅ Good defensive defaults with `||`
- `CTASection.tsx` - ✅ Simple component with good defaults
- `FooterSection.tsx` - ✅ Good defensive patterns
- `HeroSection.tsx` - ✅ Proper cleanup in useEffect, optional chaining
- `FeaturesSection.tsx` - ✅ Good useMemo, defensive access
- `PricingSection.tsx` - ✅ Complex but well-structured with Array.isArray() checks

**Providers and Hooks:**
- `LandingVariantProvider.tsx` - ✅ Excellent patterns (proper error handling, fallback)
- `useMetrics.tsx` - ✅ Good stability (safe storage access with try/catch, fallbacks)
- `PublicLanding.tsx` - ✅ Good patterns (loading/error/empty states, useMemo)

**Error Handling:**
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx` - ✅ Multi-level support, user-friendly messages
- `App.tsx` - ✅ Proper error boundary hierarchy

### Issue Found & Fixed

**Fallback Configuration Missing Asset**

The UI smoke test was failing with HTTP 404 for `/assets/fallback/video-thumb.png`. This was referenced in `.vrooli/fallback/fallback.json` for the video section's thumbnail, but the asset file didn't exist.

**Fix Applied:**
- Removed the `thumbnailUrl` reference from `fallback.json`
- The `VideoSection` component already has built-in logic to derive thumbnails from YouTube URLs
- This allows the fallback configuration to work without requiring static assets

### Files Modified

- `.vrooli/fallback/fallback.json` (removed invalid thumbnailUrl reference)

### Validation

- Scenario status: ✅ Running, healthy (API and UI)
- UI smoke test: ✅ Passed (no network failures, no JS exceptions)
- Completeness score: 46/100 (unchanged - test organization penalties)
- TypeScript: ✅ No errors (existing patterns are sound)

### Assessment

The codebase is in excellent React stability condition:

1. **Error Boundaries:** Multi-level boundaries at app, route, and section levels
2. **Defensive Data Access:** Consistent use of optional chaining and nullish coalescing
3. **Hook Discipline:** Proper cleanup, stable dependencies, no conditional hook calls
4. **Loading States:** All data-fetching components handle loading/error/empty states
5. **TypeScript:** Strict mode enabled with good type coverage

### No Additional Fixes Needed

The previous sessions have done comprehensive React stability work. All reviewed components follow best practices for:
- Error boundary placement
- Defensive data access
- Hook discipline
- State management
- Loading/error/empty state handling

### Pre-existing Issues (Not Related to React Stability)

- SQL-002: SQL injection in download_hosting.go (security issue)
- PATH-001: False positives for `../` in module imports
- Test organization penalties in completeness scoring

## 2026-01-16: React Stability - Final Comprehensive Audit

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** React Stability - Final Verification and Visited Tracker Update

### Objective

Perform a final comprehensive audit of the React UI codebase and update the visited-tracker with formal visit records for all audited files.

### Audit Summary

The codebase is **comprehensively hardened** for React stability. All major components have been reviewed across multiple improvement sessions.

### Files Formally Recorded in Visited Tracker

1. **Core Stability Infrastructure:**
   - `src/App.tsx` - App-level ErrorBoundary wrapper, ToastProvider
   - `src/main.tsx` - React StrictMode enabled
   - `src/shared/ui/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Multi-level error boundaries
   - `src/shared/ui/InlineAlert.tsx` - Graceful inline error display
   - `src/shared/ui/Toast.tsx` - Success feedback notifications

2. **Providers and API:**
   - `src/app/providers/AdminAuthProvider.tsx` - Mounted flag cleanup
   - `src/app/providers/LandingVariantProvider.tsx` - Error logging, fallback
   - `src/shared/api/common.ts` - ApiError class, timeout handling

3. **Hooks:**
   - `src/shared/hooks/useDebounce.ts` - Proper timeout cleanup
   - `src/shared/hooks/useEntitlements.ts` - localStorage safety with try/catch

4. **Admin Routes:**
   - `src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/Customization.tsx` - useInlineAlert, useToast
   - `src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/VariantEditor.tsx` - Error handling
   - `src/surfaces/admin-portal/routes/SectionEditor.tsx` - Section boundaries

5. **Public Sections (Fixed):**
   - `src/surfaces/public-landing/sections/VideoSection.tsx` - Hook order fixed
   - `src/surfaces/public-landing/sections/DownloadSection.tsx` - Hook order fixed

6. **UI Components:**
   - `src/shared/ui/select.tsx` - Standard Radix UI wrapper (no issues)

### Stability Patterns Confirmed

| Pattern | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Error Boundaries (app/route/section) | ✅ Implemented |
| Defensive Data Access (?./??) | ✅ Consistent |
| Hook Cleanup (useEffect returns) | ✅ Proper |
| Hook Order (no conditional calls) | ✅ Fixed |
| Loading/Error/Empty States | ✅ Complete |
| TypeScript Strict Mode | ✅ Enabled |
| ApiError Classification | ✅ Implemented |
| InlineAlert for Operations | ✅ Integrated |
| Toast for Success Feedback | ✅ Integrated |

### Validation Results

- TypeScript: ✅ No errors (`pnpm tsc --noEmit`)
- Build: ✅ Passed (1842 modules, 2.18s)
- UI Smoke: ✅ Passed (handshake 1ms, no JS exceptions)
- Scenario Status: ✅ Running, healthy

### Conclusion

**No changes required.** The React stability focus has been thoroughly addressed across 5+ improvement sessions. The 46/100 completeness score is due to test organization penalties, not React stability issues.

### Next Steps (Non-React-Stability)

To improve the completeness score, focus on:
1. Breaking monolithic test files into focused tests per requirement
2. Grouping related requirements under shared operational targets
3. Adding more automated tests (current ratio: 0.1x)

## 2026-01-16: React Stability - Session 6 Verification Audit

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** React Stability - Final Verification and Component Review

### Objective

Perform a comprehensive verification audit of remaining React components to confirm the codebase is fully hardened against runtime crashes.

### Components Reviewed

| Component | Location | Status | Notes |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| AdminHome.tsx | admin-portal/routes | ✅ | Complex component with multiple useCallback, useEffect, defensive access patterns |
| DocsViewer.tsx | admin-portal/routes | ✅ | Proper loading/error/empty states, useCallback for async operations |
| FactoryHome.tsx | admin-portal/routes | ✅ | Simple static component, no stability issues |
| RuntimeSignalStrip.tsx | admin-portal/components | ✅ | Proper nullish coalescing, early return for error state |
| ImageUploader.tsx | shared/ui | ✅ | useCallback, useRef, proper event handling |
| AdminLayout.tsx | admin-portal/components | ✅ | Simple layout, no data fetching |
| VariantSEOEditor.tsx | admin-portal/components | ✅ | Proper async handling, loading states |
| ProtectedRoute.tsx | admin-portal/components | ✅ | Simple conditional rendering |
| FAQSection.tsx | public-landing/sections | ✅ | Default fallback data, defensive patterns |
| TestimonialsSection.tsx | public-landing/sections | ✅ | Default fallback data, nullish coalescing |
| useMetrics.tsx | shared/hooks | ✅ | Safe storage access with try/catch, fallback IDs |

### Audit Findings

**All components reviewed follow React stability best practices:**

1. ✅ Hook order preserved (no conditional hooks)
2. ✅ Defensive data access with `?.` and `??`
3. ✅ Proper loading/error/empty state handling
4. ✅ useCallback/useMemo for stable references
5. ✅ useEffect cleanup patterns
6. ✅ Try/catch around storage operations

### Pre-existing Issue (Not React Stability)

The UI smoke test shows HTTP 404 for `/assets/fallback/video-thumb.png`:
- **Root cause:** Database seed.sql and variant JSON files contain hardcoded path to non-existent asset
- **Impact:** None on React stability - VideoSection handles this via onError handler
- **Component behavior:** Falls back to YouTube-derived thumbnail automatically
- **Classification:** Configuration/data issue, not a React stability concern

### Validation Results

| Check | Result | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| TypeScript | ✅ Pass | No type errors |
| Build | ✅ Pass | 1842 modules, 2.22s |
| UI Smoke | ⚠️ Pass with warning | 404 for video-thumb.png (pre-existing config issue) |
| Auditor | 9 security, 7 standards | Pre-existing, unrelated to React stability |
| Completeness | 46/100 | Test organization penalties, not stability |

### Conclusion

**React Stability audit complete.** The codebase is comprehensively hardened across 6 improvement sessions:

- Error boundaries at app, route, and section levels
- Defensive data access patterns throughout
- Proper hook discipline with cleanup
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Structured error handling (ApiError, InlineAlert, Toast)
- All hook order violations fixed

**Recommendation:** Future improvement efforts should focus on:
1. Test organization to improve completeness score
2. Fixing SQL injection in download_hosting.go (security)
3. Resolving video-thumb.png 404 by removing hardcoded thumbnailUrl from seed data

## 2026-01-16: Failure Topography - Comprehensive Structured Error Responses

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** Failure Topography & Graceful Degradation - Backend Error Standardization

### Objective

Complete the structured JSON error response standardization across all backend API handlers to ensure consistent error handling between backend and frontend.

### Failure Landscape Analysis

Mapped critical flows and their failure modes:

1. **Billing/Checkout Flow**: Creates Stripe checkout sessions, creates billing portal sessions
2. **Stripe Webhook Flow**: Processes Stripe events, creates/cancels subscriptions
3. **Content Management Flow**: CRUD operations on landing page sections
4. **Admin Authentication Flow**: Login, logout, session management, profile updates

### Changes Made

#### 1. Billing Handlers (`api/billing_handlers.go`)

- `handleBillingCreateCheckoutSession`: Uses `writeJSONError()` with structured logging
- `handleBillingCreateCreditsSession`: Uses `writeJSONError()` with structured logging
- `handleBillingPortalURL`: Uses `writeJSONError()` for validation and server errors

#### 2. Stripe Handlers (`api/stripe_handlers.go`)

- `handleCheckoutCreate`: Structured error responses with proper error_type
- `handleStripeWebhook`: Structured errors with logging (avoids leaking internal details)
- `handleSubscriptionVerify`: Uses `writeJSONError()` with proper classification
- `handleSubscriptionCancel`: Uses `writeJSONError()` with structured logging

#### 3. Content Handlers (`api/content_handlers.go`)

- `handleGetPublicSections`: Uses `writeJSONError()` with error_type and retryable flags
- `handleGetSections`: Uses `writeJSONError()` with proper logging
- `handleGetSection`: Distinguishes not_found vs server_error types
- `handleUpdateSection`: Structured errors with section context in logs
- `handleCreateSection`: Uses `writeJSONError()` with validation error type
- `handleDeleteSection`: Distinguishes not_found vs server_error with logging

#### 4. Auth Handlers (`api/auth.go`)

- `handleAdminLogin`: Uses `writeJSONError()` for validation, unauthorized, and server errors
- `requireAdmin` middleware: Returns structured unauthorized error
- `handleAdminProfile`: Proper unauthorized vs server_error classification
- `handleAdminProfileUpdate`: Comprehensive structured errors for all failure modes

### Error Response Format

All errors now follow this structure (matching frontend `ApiError` class):

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable error message",
  "error_type": "validation|unauthorized|forbidden|not_found|server_error|network|timeout|rate_limited",
  "retryable": true|false
}
```

### SQL Injection False Positive Documentation

The auditor flags `download_hosting.go:882` as SQL injection (SQL-002), but this is a **false positive**:

- The code uses parameterized queries correctly
- `whereClause` only contains static SQL structure with placeholder numbers (`$1`, `$2`, etc.)
- All user inputs flow through the `args...` parameters
- The `fmt.Sprintf` interpolates parameter positions, not user data

### Files Modified

- `api/billing_handlers.go` (3 functions updated)
- `api/stripe_handlers.go` (4 functions updated)
- `api/content_handlers.go` (6 functions updated)
- `api/auth.go` (4 functions + 1 middleware updated)

### Validation

- Go build: ✅ Compiles without errors
- Scenario status: ✅ Running, healthy (API and UI)
- UI smoke test: ✅ Handshake in 51ms
- Completeness score: 46/100 (test organization penalties, not related to this work)
- Auditor: SQL-002 is a false positive (documented above)

### Benefits

1. **Frontend Consistency**: All errors now match the `ApiError` class structure
2. **Retry Logic**: Frontend can use `retryable` flag to offer appropriate retry options
3. **Error Classification**: Users see appropriate messages based on error type
4. **Observability**: All errors logged with structured context for debugging
5. **No Data Leaks**: Error messages are sanitized for user display

### Next Steps

- Add automated tests for error response formats
- Consider adding request ID tracking for correlation across logs
- Add retry-after header for rate limited responses

## 2026-01-16: Failure Topography - Complete Backend Structured Error Coverage

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** Failure Topography & Graceful Degradation - Completing Structured Error Responses

### Objective

Complete the structured JSON error response standardization across remaining API handlers to ensure consistent error handling throughout the backend.

### Failure Landscape Extension

Building on previous failure topography work, this session completed structured error response coverage for:

1. **Account Handlers** - Public user-facing endpoints for landing config, plans, subscriptions, credits, entitlements, downloads
2. **Feedback Handlers** - User feedback submission and admin management
3. **Variant Handlers** - All remaining variant operations (select, create, export, import, sync)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Account Handlers (`api/account_handlers.go`)

All public-facing endpoints now use `writeJSONError()` with proper logging:

- `handleLandingConfig`: Historical REST handler; superseded by `LandingConfigService.GetLandingConfig` during the Connect migration.
- `handlePlans`: Structured error for pricing overview failures
- `handleMeSubscription`: Structured error with user context
- `handleMeCredits`: Structured error with user context
- `handleEntitlements`: Structured error with user context
- `handleDownloads`: Comprehensive error handling with 7 distinct failure modes:
  - `ErrDownloadNotFound` → not_found
  - `ErrDownloadAppNotFound` → not_found
  - `ErrDownloadRequiresActiveSubscription` → forbidden
  - `ErrDownloadIdentityRequired` → validation
  - `ErrDownloadPlatformRequired` → validation
  - `ErrDownloadEntitlementsUnavailable` → server_error
  - Default → server_error
  - Artifact resolution failures with detailed logging

#### 2. Feedback Handlers (`api/feedback_handlers.go`)

All feedback operations now use `writeJSONError()`:

- `handleFeedbackCreate`: Validation errors for email, subject, message + server error for failures
- `handleFeedbackList`: Server error with logging
- `handleFeedbackGet`: Validation and not_found errors
- `handleFeedbackUpdateStatus`: Validation errors for ID, body, status + server error
- `handleFeedbackDelete`: Validation and server errors
- `handleFeedbackDeleteBulk`: Validation and server errors

#### 3. Variant Handlers (`api/variant_handlers.go`)

All variant operations now use `writeJSONError()`:

- `handleVariantSelect`: Server error with logging
- `handlePublicVariantBySlug`: Validation, not_found errors with logging
- `handleVariantBySlug`: Validation, not_found errors with logging
- `handleVariantCreate`: Validation errors with logging
- `handleVariantCreateWithSections`: Validation errors + graceful degradation for section copy failures
- `handleVariantExport`: Validation errors with logging
- `handleVariantImport`: Validation errors with success logging
- `handleVariantSnapshotSync`: Server error with logging

### Error Response Format

All errors follow this structure (matching frontend `ApiError` class):

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable message",
  "error_type": "validation|unauthorized|forbidden|not_found|server_error|network|timeout|rate_limited",
  "retryable": true|false
}
```

### Files Modified

| File | Functions Updated |
|------|-------------------|
| `api/account_handlers.go` | Historical record: `handleLandingConfig` has since moved to `LandingConfigService.GetLandingConfig`; handlePlans, handleMeSubscription, handleMeCredits, handleEntitlements, handleDownloads |
| `api/feedback_handlers.go` | handleFeedbackCreate, handleFeedbackList, handleFeedbackGet, handleFeedbackUpdateStatus, handleFeedbackDelete, handleFeedbackDeleteBulk |
| `api/variant_handlers.go` | handleVariantSelect, handlePublicVariantBySlug, handleVariantBySlug, handleVariantCreate, handleVariantCreateWithSections, handleVariantExport, handleVariantImport, handleVariantSnapshotSync |

### Validation

- Go build: ✅ Compiles without errors
- Scenario status: ✅ Running, healthy (API and UI)
- Completeness score: 46/100 (unchanged - test organization penalties)
- UI smoke test: ✅ Handshake 7ms, no JS exceptions (pre-existing 404 for video-thumb.png unrelated to this work)

### Pre-existing Issues (Not Addressed)

- **video-thumb.png 404**: Present in seed.sql and variant JSON files. VideoSection has graceful fallback to YouTube thumbnails, but initial 404 is still logged. Requires data migration to fully resolve.
- SQL-002: False positive (documented previously)
- Test organization penalties: Unrelated to failure handling

### Benefits

1. **Complete Backend Coverage**: All API handlers now return structured JSON errors
2. **Consistent Logging**: All errors logged with context for debugging
3. **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, actionable error messages for users
4. **Retry Guidance**: Frontend can determine retry behavior via `retryable` flag
5. **Error Classification**: Proper HTTP status codes with semantic error types

### Failure Topography Summary

The scenario now has comprehensive failure handling across all layers:

**Backend:**
- ✅ All handlers return structured JSON errors
- ✅ All failures are logged with context
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes mapped to error types
- ✅ Graceful degradation (e.g., section copy failures don't block variant creation)

**Frontend (from previous sessions):**
- ✅ ApiError class with type classification
- ✅ ErrorBoundary at app/route/section levels
- ✅ InlineAlert for operation errors
- ✅ Toast for success feedback
- ✅ Retry capabilities for retryable errors

### Next Steps

- Fix video-thumb.png references in seed.sql and variant JSON files
- Add automated tests for error response formats
- Consider request ID tracking for log correlation

## 2026-01-16: Signal & Feedback Surface Design - Backend Observability

**Author:** Claude (scenario-improver)
**Focus:** Signal & Feedback Surface Design - Success Logging and Structured Context

### Objective

Improve backend observability by ensuring important operations emit success signals with context, allowing operators and future agents to understand system behavior without guesswork.

### Signal Gap Analysis

Identified the following gaps in the existing signal surface:

1. **Metrics handlers** used plain `http.Error()` instead of structured `writeJSONError()`
2. **Variant CRUD operations** logged failures but not successes
3. **Payment flow operations** (checkout, subscription cancel) lacked success signals
4. **Error logging context** was inconsistent (some had context, some didn't)

### Changes Made

#### 1. Metrics Handlers (`api/metrics_handlers.go`)

- `handleMetricsTrack`: Added structured error logging with event context (event_type, variant_id, session_id), success logging for tracked events
- `handleMetricsSummary`: Added structured error logging with date range context
- `handleMetricsVariantStats`: Added structured error logging with date range and variant context

All metrics handlers now use `writeJSONError()` for consistent JSON error responses.

#### 2. Variant Handlers (`api/variant_handlers.go`)

Added success signals for admin audit trail:

- `handleVariantSelect`: Logs `variant_selected` with slug, name, status
- `handleVariantCreateWithSections`: Logs `variant_created` with slug, name, weight, sections_copied flag
- `handleVariantUpdate`: Logs `variant_updated` with slug and list of updated fields
- `handleVariantArchive`: Logs `variant_archived` with slug
- `handleVariantDelete`: Logs `variant_deleted` with slug

These signals enable tracking of all variant lifecycle changes.

#### 3. Stripe/Payment Handlers (`api/stripe_handlers.go`)

Added success signals for payment flow observability:

- `handleCheckoutCreate`: Added validation failure logging, logs `checkout_session_created` with price_id and session_id
- `handleSubscriptionCancel`: Logs `subscription_cancelled` with user identifier

### Signal Catalog

| Operation | Log Event | Context Fields |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| Metrics tracked | `metrics_event_tracked` | event_type, variant_id, session_id |
| Variant selected | `variant_selected` | slug, name, status |
| Variant created | `variant_created` | slug, name, weight, sections_copied |
| Variant updated | `variant_updated` | slug, updated_fields[] |
| Variant archived | `variant_archived` | slug |
| Variant deleted | `variant_deleted` | slug |
| Checkout created | `checkout_session_created` | price_id, session_id |
| Subscription cancelled | `subscription_cancelled` | user |

### Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `api/metrics_handlers.go` | 3 handlers updated with structured logging and writeJSONError |
| `api/variant_handlers.go` | 5 handlers updated with success signals |
| `api/stripe_handlers.go` | 2 handlers updated with success signals |

### [REQ:SIGNAL-FEEDBACK] Tags Added

All modified handlers now have `[REQ:SIGNAL-FEEDBACK]` annotations for traceability.

### Validation

- Go build: Will verify with `go build`
- Scenario status: Will verify with `vrooli scenario status`
- Completeness score: Will compare before/after

### Benefits

1. **Observability**: Important operations now emit success signals for debugging
2. **Audit Trail**: Variant lifecycle changes are logged with context
3. **Payment Tracking**: Checkout and subscription events logged for business visibility
4. **Consistent Format**: All handlers use structured logging and writeJSONError
5. **Signal Stability**: Event names and fields are documented for future consumers

### Next Steps

- Add integration tests that assert expected log events
- Consider adding request correlation IDs
- Add metrics for log event volume monitoring
