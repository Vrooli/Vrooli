    # Time allocation: See global_config.time_allocations.generators
    
    success_criteria:
      - "Unique resource verified: `grep -r 'resource_name' resources/` returns no matches"
      - "v2.0 contract compliance: `ls lib/` shows setup.sh, develop.sh, test.sh, stop.sh, health.sh"
      - "Health checks working: `timeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:${PORT}/health` returns 200"
      - "Lifecycle hooks implemented: All `lib/*.sh` scripts execute without errors"
      - "CLI integration functional: `vrooli resource RESOURCE_NAME help` shows available commands"
      - "Port allocation successful: `netstat -tlnp | grep PORT` shows service listening"
      - "PRD complete: All mandatory sections present, 5+ P0 requirements with test commands"
    
    principles:
      - "v2.0 contract is mandatory"
      - "Health checks are critical"
      - "Port allocation must not conflict"

    success_criteria:
      - "v2.0 contract compliance improved: Missing files in `ls lib/` are now present and executable"
      - "Health checks more robust: `timeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:${PORT}/health` passes with error details"
      - "CLI commands standardized: `vrooli resource NAME help` shows status, health, logs, content commands"
      - "No regressions: All previously passing `lib/test.sh` tests still pass"
      - "Security & standards baseline captured: `resource-auditor audit NAME --timeout 240` recorded before changes"
      - "Documentation updated: README reflects actual implementation, no broken links"
      - "Memory system updated: `vrooli resource qdrant search 'resource_name'` returns updated info"
    
    principles:
      - "v2.0 compliance is priority #1"
      - "Health checks must be reliable"
      - "Preserve working functionality"

      - "Operational Targets PRD present: Overview + P0/P1/P2 sections tied to requirement IDs"
      - "Requirements registry seeded with valid IDs, criticality, prd_ref, and documentation in requirements/README.md"
      - "Lifecycle metadata configured: `.vrooli/service.json` (plus required files) allows `vrooli scenario status <name>` to run without schema errors"
      - "Baseline documentation created: README.md, docs/PROGRESS.md, docs/PROBLEMS.md, docs/RESEARCH.md with initial entries"
    
    principles:
      - "Research prevents duplication"
      - "PRD is the primary deliverable"

      - "Progress measurable: At least one P0/P1 operational target has linked requirements/tests moved to passing status and logged in docs/PROGRESS.md"
      - "No regressions verified: All previously working features tested and still functional"
      - "Security & standards baseline captured: `scenario-auditor audit NAME --timeout 240` recorded before changes"
      - "Validation gates pass: Health, functionality, security, and integration tests all succeed"
      - "Cross-scenario impacts assessed: Dependencies checked, no breaking changes to other scenarios"
      - "Documentation updated: README + docs/PROBLEMS.md reflect new findings and outstanding work"
    
    principles:
      - "Trust but verify everything"
      - "Incremental progress is permanent"
      - "PRD accuracy is sacred"
      - "Expose existing security debt before implementing fixes"
      - "Small focused changes win"
