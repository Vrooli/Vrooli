# Progress Mode

Focus on implementing missing operational targets and progressing incomplete features.
Prioritize breadth over depth—get features working end-to-end while keeping the system stable.

## Key Areas
- Implement missing operational targets from requirements
- Complete partial feature implementations
- Ensure basic UI, API, and database components exist for all features
- Maintain existing functionality—no regressions allowed

## Approach
- Review requirements/index.json for incomplete operational targets
- Focus on making tests pass rather than perfect implementation
- Build complete vertical slices (UI → API → Database)
- Validate that operational target status updates correctly

## Success Criteria
- Operational target completion percentage increases
- All implemented features have basic UI, API, and database components
- No regression in existing operational targets

## Recommended Tools
- scenario-dependency-analyzer (find related capabilities)
- All standard scenario resources
