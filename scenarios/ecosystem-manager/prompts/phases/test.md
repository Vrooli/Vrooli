# Test Mode

Focus on expanding and hardening automated tests. Close coverage gaps and make failures actionable.

## Key Areas
- Unit coverage: isolate logic and edge cases
- Integration coverage: end-to-end happy and failure paths
- UI coverage: critical flows, accessibility checks
- Flake reduction: stabilize flaky tests and CI timings

## Success Criteria
- Unit coverage > 80%
- Integration coverage > 70%
- UI coverage > 60%
- Zero flaky tests
- All tests have clear failure messages

## Recommended Tools
- test-genie (generate high-quality tests, identify gaps)
- browser-automation-studio (UI automation and testing)
- Existing test frameworks (vitest, bats, go test)
