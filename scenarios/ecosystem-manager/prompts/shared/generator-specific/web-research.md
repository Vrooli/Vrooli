# Web Research Phase

## External Research Requirements

For generator scenarios, conduct comprehensive web research before implementation:

### 1. Technology Assessment
- Search for existing open-source implementations
- Review documentation of similar tools/platforms
- Identify best practices and design patterns
- Check for security considerations

### 2. Market Analysis
- Identify competitors and alternatives
- Analyze pricing models if applicable
- Understand user pain points
- Find unique differentiation opportunities

### 3. Technical Standards
- Research relevant RFCs and specifications
- Check for industry standards
- Review API design guidelines
- Understand compliance requirements

### 4. Integration Research
- Identify popular integrations
- Research webhook patterns
- Check for standard data formats
- Understand authentication methods

## Research Documentation

Document all findings in the PRD under:
- "Prior Art" section
- "Technical Standards" section
- "Integration Opportunities" section
- "Competitive Analysis" section

## Time Allocation
Spend at least 30% of research time on external sources to ensure:
- We're not reinventing the wheel
- We're following industry best practices
- We're aware of potential pitfalls
- We can offer unique value
