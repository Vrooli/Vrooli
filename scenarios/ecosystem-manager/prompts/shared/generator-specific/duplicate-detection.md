# Duplicate Detection

## Critical Requirement

**CRITICAL: Never create duplicates unless explicitly instructed to do so.**

When told to create something new which actually already exists, you should work on improving the existing implementation instead.

## Quick Check
Before creating any new resource or scenario, verify it doesn't already exist:
- Search for the name in existing resources/scenarios
- Check for similar functionality  
- If >80% overlap exists, improve the existing one instead

## Document in PRD
If proceeding with creation, document differentiation per 'prd-protocol' section requirements.
