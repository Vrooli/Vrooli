# PRD Creation Phase

## Purpose
The PRD is the **PRIMARY DELIVERABLE** for generators (50% of total effort).

## Requirements
See the 'prd-protocol' section for:
- Complete PRD structure and requirements
- Quality gates and validation criteria
- Examples and templates
- Common mistakes to avoid

## Remember
Every hour spent on a good PRD saves 10 hours of future confusion. The PRD defines the permanent capability being added to Vrooli and guides all future improvements.
