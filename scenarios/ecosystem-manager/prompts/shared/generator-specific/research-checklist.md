## Generator Research Checklist (5 Must-Do Items)

Complete these 5 critical steps before creating anything new:

### Core Research Tasks
- [ ] **Search for duplicates**: Run memory search to find existing similar work
- [ ] **Find reusable templates**: Identify templates or patterns to copy from
- [ ] **Validate market need**: Confirm this solves a real problem (for scenarios)
- [ ] **Check technical feasibility**: Verify required resources are available
- [ ] **Learn from failures**: Find what's been tried and didn't work

### Memory Search
Use the standard search patterns:
{{INCLUDE: core/memory-search-patterns.md}}

### Research Output Format

Document your findings simply:

**Similar Work Found**: [List 2-3 most similar existing implementations]
**Template Selected**: [Which template/pattern to start from]
**Unique Value**: [What makes this different in 1 sentence]
**Go/No-Go Decision**: [Proceed or improve existing instead?]

### Stop Conditions

**DON'T proceed if:**
- Found 80%+ similar existing work
- Required resources unavailable
- No clear unique value

**DO proceed if:**
- Unique value confirmed
- Template selected to copy from
- Technical feasibility validated
