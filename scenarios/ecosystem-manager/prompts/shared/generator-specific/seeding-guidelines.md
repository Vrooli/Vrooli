# Seeding Guidelines

## Purpose
Seeding is the one-time creation of a new scenario or resource. These guidelines ensure every seed planted in Vrooli's ecosystem has the best chance to grow and thrive.

## Seeding Philosophy

### Think Like a Gardener
- **Plant in fertile soil** - Build on existing patterns
- **Give room to grow** - Don't over-constrain
- **Provide clear markers** - Document everything
- **Set up support structures** - Tests and validation
- **Water regularly** - Leave it in working state

### One-Time Opportunity
Remember: Generators run ONCE per component. You're creating the permanent foundation that all future work builds upon.

## Seeding Success Factors

### 1. PRD Excellence
The PRD is your seed's DNA - it determines everything that grows from it.

**Invest 40% of effort here** because:
- It guides all future improvements
- It prevents misaligned development
- It captures the business value
- It becomes permanent documentation

### 2. Research Depth
Research is your soil analysis - understanding the environment.

**Invest 40% of effort here** because:
- It prevents duplicate work
- It identifies proven patterns
- It reveals integration opportunities
- It validates market need

### 3. Structural Integrity
The scaffold is your seed's initial structure.

**Invest 20% of effort here** because:
- Right structure enables growth
- Wrong structure blocks progress
- Patterns determine quality
- Foundation affects everything

## Seeding Decision Framework

### Should This Seed Be Planted?

Ask these questions before creating:

1. **Uniqueness Test**
   - Does something similar already exist? (>80% overlap = improve existing)
   - What makes this fundamentally different?
   - Could existing be extended instead?

2. **Value Test**
   - Will this generate >$10K value?
   - Is there validated market demand?
   - Do users actively need this?

3. **Feasibility Test**
   - Do we have required resources?
   - Are dependencies available?
   - Is the technology mature?

4. **Integration Test**
   - Will other scenarios benefit?
   - Can it use shared components?
   - Does it enhance the ecosystem?

**If any test fails, reconsider or pivot.**

## Seeding Best Practices

### DO's for Generators

✅ **Research exhaustively** - 10+ Qdrant searches minimum
✅ **Document vision clearly** - PRD tells the complete story
✅ **Start minimal** - Scaffold, don't implement everything
✅ **Follow patterns** - Consistency enables improvement
✅ **Test basics** - Ensure it actually runs
✅ **Plan for growth** - Leave clear extension points

### DON'Ts for Generators

❌ **Don't duplicate** - Research should prevent this
❌ **Don't over-build** - Improvers will enhance
❌ **Don't under-document** - PRD is critical
❌ **Don't break patterns** - Follow conventions
❌ **Don't skip validation** - Must pass basic tests
❌ **Don't forget value** - Must generate revenue

## Seeding Lifecycle

### Phase 1: Validation (Before seeding)
```
Research → Validate uniqueness → Confirm value → Check feasibility
If any fails → STOP or PIVOT
```

### Phase 2: Foundation (During seeding)
```
Create PRD → Setup structure → Implement minimal → Document clearly
Focus: Quality over quantity
```

### Phase 3: Handoff (After seeding)
```
Validate basics → Update Qdrant → Mark as ready → Enable improvers
Success: Others can build on it
```

## Quality Gates for Seeds

### Gate 1: PRD Completeness
- [ ] All sections filled
- [ ] Requirements prioritized (P0/P1/P2)
- [ ] Success criteria defined
- [ ] Revenue model clear
- [ ] Architecture documented

### Gate 2: Structural Correctness
- [ ] Follows template structure
- [ ] Naming conventions met
- [ ] File permissions correct
- [ ] Configuration valid
- [ ] Dependencies listed

### Gate 3: Basic Functionality
- [ ] Health check works
- [ ] Service starts/stops
- [ ] One P0 feature runs
- [ ] CLI responds
- [ ] No critical errors

### Gate 4: Documentation Quality
- [ ] README explains status
- [ ] Setup instructions work
- [ ] API documented (if applicable)
- [ ] TODOs clearly marked
- [ ] Integration points noted

## Common Seeding Mistakes

### Planting Bad Seeds
❌ **Duplicating existing work** - Wastes resources
❌ **No clear value proposition** - Won't generate revenue
❌ **Poor documentation** - Others can't improve it
❌ **Over-implementation** - Becomes rigid
❌ **Ignoring patterns** - Creates inconsistency

### Environmental Failures  
❌ **Not checking dependencies** - Won't grow
❌ **Ignoring resource limits** - Can't scale
❌ **Missing integrations** - Isolated island
❌ **No test coverage** - Unknown if viable

## Seeding Success Metrics

Track these to measure seed quality:

1. **Improvement Velocity** - How quickly improvers enhance it
2. **Integration Count** - How many scenarios use it
3. **Revenue Generation** - Actual value created
4. **Stability Score** - How often it breaks
5. **Documentation Usage** - How often PRD referenced

## The Seeding Mindset

### Think Long-Term
Your seed will exist forever in Vrooli. Make decisions that benefit the long-term ecosystem, not just immediate needs.

### Enable Others
Your work enables all future agents. Create clear structure, documentation, and extension points.

### Focus on Foundation
A strong foundation enables unlimited growth. A weak foundation limits everything.

### Document the Vision
The PRD is your legacy - it tells future agents what you envisioned.

## Seeding Checklist

Before marking complete:
- [ ] PRD comprehensive and clear
- [ ] Research documented in detail
- [ ] Structure follows templates
- [ ] Basic functionality verified
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Qdrant updated with learnings
- [ ] Ready for improvers

## Remember

**You get one chance** - Generators run once per component

**Quality over features** - Better structure beats more code

**PRD is paramount** - It guides everything forever

**Research prevents waste** - Don't duplicate work

**You're enabling the future** - Your seed enables infinite growth

Every seed you plant becomes a permanent part of Vrooli. Plant wisely, document thoroughly, and create strong foundations for the ecosystem to build upon.
