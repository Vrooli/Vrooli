# PRD Essentials

## Quick Reference
- **PRD** = Product Requirements Document
- **Priority**: P0 (must have) > P1 (should have) > P2 (nice to have)  
- **Progress**: Track via checkboxes (☐/✅) with completion percentages
- **Purpose**: Define permanent capability being added to Vrooli

## Core Structure
```markdown
## P0 Requirements (Must Have - 5-7 max)
- [ ] **Feature Name**: What it must do
- [ ] **Health Check**: Must respond with status
- [ ] **Lifecycle**: setup/develop/test/stop work

## P1 Requirements (Should Have - 3-4 max)  
## P2 Requirements (Nice to Have - 2-3 max)
```

## PRD Rules
1. **Checkbox accuracy is sacred** - Only check when tested/verified
2. **Progress reflects reality** - Percentages match actual completion  
3. **Requirements are testable** - Each has validation command
4. **PRD drives development** - Implementation follows requirements
