# Improvement Prioritization

## Purpose
When improving a resource or scenario, prioritize changes by impact and feasibility. Focus on high-value improvements you can complete successfully.

## Improvement Priority Framework

### For Resources
**1. Critical Issues (Fix First)**
- Missing v2.0 contract requirements
- Broken health checks
- Security vulnerabilities
- System won't start

**2. High-Impact Improvements**
- Better error handling
- Performance optimization
- CLI standardization
- Documentation accuracy

**3. Quality Improvements**
- Code cleanup
- Test coverage
- Better logging
- Configuration validation

**4. Nice-to-Have**
- Minor optimizations
- Cosmetic improvements
- Future-proofing

### For Scenarios  
**1. Critical Issues (Fix First)**
- Security vulnerabilities
- Data corruption risks
- System stability issues
- Broken core features

**2. High-Impact Improvements**
- User experience enhancements
- Performance improvements >20%
- Cross-scenario compatibility
- Documentation for complex workflows

**3. Quality Improvements**
- Code maintainability
- Test coverage
- Error handling
- Technical debt reduction

**4. Nice-to-Have**
- Experimental features
- Minor UI tweaks
- Future enhancements

## Choosing What to Work On

When improving your assigned resource or scenario, focus on changes that deliver the most value with the highest chance of success.

### Quick Assessment Questions
1. **What's broken right now?** (Fix first)
2. **What would help users most?** (High impact)
3. **What can I complete successfully?** (Feasibility)
4. **What builds on existing work?** (Momentum)

### Balancing Priorities
- **Start with critical issues** - Get basic functionality working
- **Then target high-impact improvements** - Address user pain points
- **Mix in quality improvements** - Maintain code health
- **Skip nice-to-haves** unless everything else is done

### Making Trade-offs
Choose improvements that are:
- **High impact AND achievable** over low impact but easy
- **Fixes over features** when system has problems
- **Documented over undocumented** for long-term value
- **Tested over untested** for reliability

The goal is meaningful progress on your assigned resource or scenario, not perfect completion of everything.
