# Task Completion Protocol

## Purpose
When you complete your assigned task, properly document your work and update the task status to enable future improvements.

## Task Completion Steps

### 1. Final Validation
Verify your work actually functions:
- Test key features you implemented/improved
- Confirm health checks pass (if applicable)
- Verify no regressions in existing functionality

### 2. Update Documentation
Follow the `scripts/resources/contracts/v2.0/universal.yaml` guidelines for proper documentation structure:

**For Resources and Scenarios:**
- Update PRD.md per 'prd-protocol' section requirements
- Update README.md to reflect current capabilities
- Document any new configuration or dependencies
- Note any API changes or new endpoints (scenarios)

### 3. Capture Learnings
Document insights in your response that will help future agents:
- What approaches worked well
- What challenges you encountered and how you solved them
- Specific test commands that validate the work
- Recommendations for future improvements

### 4. Task Status Update
The ecosystem-manager API handles moving your task file automatically. Your final response should clearly state:
- What was accomplished
- Current status (working/improved/partially complete)
- Any remaining issues or limitations
- Specific evidence that validates the work
