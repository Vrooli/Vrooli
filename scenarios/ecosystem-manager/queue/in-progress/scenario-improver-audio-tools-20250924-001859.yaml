    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    ### What was accomplished:
    - Validated all P0 requirements are working (8/8 features operational)
    - Verified scenario lifecycle functions correctly with health checks passing
    - Tested API endpoints - 5/6 automated tests pass (83% success rate)
    - Confirmed PostgreSQL integration working with database connected
    - Updated PRD to reflect actual validated state vs claimed state

    ### Current status:
    The audio-tools scenario is fully functional with all P0 requirements operational. The API provides comprehensive audio processing capabilities including editing, format conversion, normalization, and metadata extraction.

    ### Validation Evidence:
    - Health check: ✅ Returns {"database":"connected","ffmpeg":"available","service":"audio-tools","status":"healthy"}
    - Test suite: ✅ 5/6 tests passing (trim, convert, volume, normalize, health)
    - API port: Running on 19603 with proper lifecycle management
    - Database: PostgreSQL connected and operational
    - FFmpeg: Timeout handling implemented and working

    ### Remaining Issues/Limitations:
    - No UI component - Referenced in tests but not implemented
    - Metadata endpoint expects ID parameter, not file upload (minor API design issue)
    - CLI uses generic template - Not customized for audio operations
    - P1 features not implemented - Transcription, speaker detection, emotion analysis remain TODO

    ### Suggested next actions:
    1. Implement UI - Create React interface for visual audio editing
    2. Add transcription - Integrate Whisper or similar for P1 requirements
    3. Customize CLI - Update CLI commands to match audio-specific operations
    4. Add unit tests - Go code has no unit tests currently
    5. Complete P1 features - Speaker diarization, emotion detection, real-time streaming
