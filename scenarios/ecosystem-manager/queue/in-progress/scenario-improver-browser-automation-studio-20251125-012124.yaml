notes: |-
    Focus on API refactoring specifically. There has been a great effort to bring the API towards a well-organized, engine-agnostic solution. This is important because the original API had multiple monolithic (multiple thousands of lines) files with a bunch of browser engine-specific code. This was hard to work with, and made it impossible to switch the engine (which we'll need later for bundling the scenario as a native desktop app, which will have to run workflows using Electron + Playwright instead of what we do when running locally in Tier 1 vrooli).

    If that effort is complete, then there is still likely plenty of opportunities to refactor the API code to be professional, well-maintained, well-organized, well-documented, and well-tested.
