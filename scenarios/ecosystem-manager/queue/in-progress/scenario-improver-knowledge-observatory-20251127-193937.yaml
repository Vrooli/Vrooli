notes: |-
    Focus of this scenario should be both in AI search (embeddings via qdrant, generated by ollama) and managing resource and scenario docs. For example, with a common doc like PROGRESS.md, we should be able to easily clear out old progress items to reduce clutter.

    Note that the qdrant resource may have issues. You have my official permission to modify it if needed
