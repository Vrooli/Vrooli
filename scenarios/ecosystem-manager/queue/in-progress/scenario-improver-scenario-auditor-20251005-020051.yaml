notes: |-
    I don’t think the UI is connected to the API correctly - all requests are failing. The UI’s health status looks like this:

    {"status":"healthy","service":"scenario-auditor-ui","timestamp":"2025-10-05T05:56:43.206Z","uptime":185698.885476962}

    I believe if you run make status on this scenario, it’ll instruct you on fixing this health status endpoint. The correct schema includes a check to ensure that the UI is reaching the API. Once you add that, then it’ll be easier to fix the connection issue. Ultrathink
