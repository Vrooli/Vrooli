    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    ### What was accomplished:
    - Successfully implemented 3 major P1 requirements:
      - **API Categorization and Tagging System**: Added endpoints for listing categories, tags, and updating API tags.
      - **Export Capabilities (JSON, CSV)**: Implemented export endpoint with proper headers and data export.
      - **API Status Monitoring**: Added status update endpoint with sunset date tracking for deprecated APIs.
    - Enhanced test infrastructure with phased testing architecture and best-practice test runner script.

    ### Current status:
    - Working: All P0 requirements functional, 7/8 P1 requirements completed
    - PRD Progress: 85% → 95% completion
    - Performance: Maintained <100ms response times (average 17ms)
    - Tests: Unit tests passing, smoke tests passing

    ### Remaining issues or limitations:
    - Integration recipes/snippets storage not implemented for P1 item.

    ### Suggested next actions:
    - Complete integration recipes/snippets storage.
    - Review and finalize remaining PRD items.

    ### Validation evidence:
    - Health check: API responding at port 18911
    - Export endpoint: Successfully exports APIs in JSON/CSV
    - Categories: Returns AI/ML, Communication, Payment categories
    - Tags: Returns tags with usage counts
    - Status update: Successfully updated Stripe API to deprecated status
    - Smoke tests: All passing
