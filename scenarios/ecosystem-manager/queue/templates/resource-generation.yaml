notes: |
  Template guidance for new resource generation. Before execution define:
    • Base template (basic, ai-ml, communication, data, security)
    • Research focus (similar resources, contract requirements, port planning, integration points)
    • Deliverables (comprehensive PRD.md, full v2.0 contract file set, health checks, CLI integration, Docker config, documentation)
    • Specific needs or constraints, including fixed ports when required (use "auto" when flexible)
