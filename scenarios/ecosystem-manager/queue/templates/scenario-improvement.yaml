  Template guidance for scenario improvements. Before execution define:
    • Target scenario and improvement focus (PRD, UI, API, tests, documentation, revenue)
    • Assessment focus areas (current PRD accuracy, workflow pain points, API reliability, UX gaps, test depth, revenue health)
    • Expected deliverables (updated PRD, UX refinements, performance enhancements, broader tests, refreshed documentation)
    • Any specific features or requirements to implement or validate during the iteration
