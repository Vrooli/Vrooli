  Template guidance for new scenario generation. Before execution define:
    • Base template (basic, ai-powered, data-processing, business-tool, personal-utility)
    • Research focus (similar scenarios, required resources, user workflows, revenue opportunities, integration paths)
    • Deliverables (comprehensive PRD, full directory, API + UI + CLI implementations, robust tests, documentation)
    • Unique requirements, required resources, and key user journeys to prioritize
