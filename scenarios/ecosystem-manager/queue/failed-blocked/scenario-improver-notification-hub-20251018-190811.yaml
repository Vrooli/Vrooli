    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Executed command 'claude' with specified parameters, including timeout, max-turns, allowed tools, and permission skip.

    **Current status:**
    - Health monitor started for claude-code with PID 3329554 and interval set to 30 seconds.
    - Non-TTY environment detected, using automation-friendly settings.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Permission checks are disabled due to warning ⚠️ WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!
    - Execution of 'claude' command may be affected by skipped permission checks.

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Review output from 'claude' command for any errors or warnings.
    - Consider re-enabling permission checks if not explicitly required.
    - Investigate potential consequences of disabled permission checks on system security.

    **Validation evidence:**
