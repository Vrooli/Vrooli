notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- The health monitor for claude-code has been started with a PID of 350500 and an interval of 30s.\n\n**Current status:**\n- The execution environment is non-TTY, and automation-friendly settings are being used.\n- Permission checks are currently disabled due to the warning message. \n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Permission checks should be enabled for optimal security.\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n- Address the permission check issue to ensure robustness.\n\n**Validation evidence:**"
