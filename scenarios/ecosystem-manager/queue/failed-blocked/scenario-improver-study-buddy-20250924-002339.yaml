    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    - **What was accomplished:**
       - Started health monitor for claude-code (PID: 427292, interval: 30s)
       - Running in non-TTY environment with automation-friendly settings enabled
    - **Current status:**
       - Permission checks are disabled due to warning, which may impact security or functionality
    - **Remaining issues or limitations:**
       - Permission check disabling might cause unforeseen consequences or vulnerabilities
       - Health monitor started but its effectiveness is uncertain without permission checks
    - **Suggested next actions:**
       None reported
results:
    error: "Claude Code execution failed (exit code 1): [INFO]    Started health monitor for claude-code (PID: 427292, interval: 30s)\n[HEADER]  \U0001F916 Running Claude Code\n[INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n[WARNING] ⚠️  WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!\n"
