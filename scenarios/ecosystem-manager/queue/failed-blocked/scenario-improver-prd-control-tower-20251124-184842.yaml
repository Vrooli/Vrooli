    The ability to edit PRDs from the UI is great. And seeing tabs in the Scenario Control Center for viewing requirements and operational targets is super useful. However, it'd be more useful if we had the ability to manage (add/update/delete/copy/move) requirements and operational targets from these tabs (if not implemented already). This would give me more control  and freedom, as it currently feels limiting to be able to see the data but not modify it.

    Also overall, the UI seems to be mostly feature-complete. But for some reason, it seems to have a bit too much friction every time I want to use it? I'm not sure exactly what we should do, but here's some annoyances I've noticed:
    - It's hard to locate scenarios I've been working on. Perhaps if there was a way to store a visited count, we could have that as a catalog sort option
    - Some labeling system (and ability to filter results by label) would be nice, so that I can keep track of scenarios I've been working on for different reasons.
