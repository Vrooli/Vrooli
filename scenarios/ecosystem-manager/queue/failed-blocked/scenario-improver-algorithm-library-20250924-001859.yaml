    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - The health monitor for claude-code started with PID: 3524728 and an interval of 30s.
    - A non-TTY environment was detected, and automation-friendly settings were used.
    - The command `claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions` executed with a timeout of 5280 seconds.

    **Current status:**
    - There are warnings indicating that several agents (claude-code-agent-1759206756-3524697, ecosystem-scenario-improver-algorithm-library-20250924-001859, claude-code-agent-1759206786-3530541, and ecosystem-scenario-improver-invoice-generator-20250924-004259) are not running.
    - The execution of `claude` reached the maximum number of turns (80), resulting in an error.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Permission checks are disabled as a warning indicates.
    - Several agents are not running, which could impact overall system performance and functionality.

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Investigate and resolve the issue with the non-running agents.
    - Enable permission checks to ensure proper security and compliance.

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Error message indicating that the maximum number of turns was reached.
    - Warnings about disabled permission checks and non-running agents.
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
