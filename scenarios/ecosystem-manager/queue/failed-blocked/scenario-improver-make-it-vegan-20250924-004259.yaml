notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n- **What was accomplished:** \n  - Started health monitor for claude-code with PID 3831187 and a 30s interval.\n  - Executed timeout command to run claude with various flags including --print, --max-turns 80, --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep, and --dangerously-skip-permissions.\n\n- **Current status:** \n  - The execution of the timeout command has reached its weekly limit, which will reset on Oct 8, 5pm.\n  - Permission checks are disabled due to a WARNING indicating that these checks were turned off.\n\n- **Remaining issues or limitations:**\n  - Permission checks are currently disabled, which may impact task integrity.\n  - The claude code health monitor is running in an environment where permission checks are not enabled.\n\n- **Suggested next actions:** \n  None\n\n- **Validation evidence:** \n  - Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n  - Executing: timeout 3480 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions (prompt: 25598 chars)\n  - Weekly limit reached ∙ resets Oct 8, 5pm"
