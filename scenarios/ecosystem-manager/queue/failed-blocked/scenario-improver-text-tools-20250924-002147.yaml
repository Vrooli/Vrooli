notes: "Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- The health monitor for claude-code started successfully with PID 154551 and an interval of 30s.\n- Claude Code execution began in a non-TTY environment using automation-friendly settings.\n\n**Current status:**\n- Execution encountered an error due to reaching the maximum allowed turns (60).\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Permission checks are disabled as indicated by the WARNING message.\n- The execution terminated prematurely without completing the task.\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n- Review and adjust the --max-turns parameter value according to the specific requirements of the task.\n- Address the issue of disabled permission checks, if applicable, by re-enabling them or taking alternative measures for secure execution.\n \n**Validation evidence:** None reported"
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (60). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
