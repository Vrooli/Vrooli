    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Started health monitor for claude-code with PID: 534465 and interval of 30s.
    - Executing command `claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions` in a non-TTY environment.

    **Current status:**
    - Permission checks are disabled due to the `--dangerously-skip-permissions` flag.
    - Weekly limit has been reached and will reset on October 8, 5pm.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Permission checks are intentionally skipped, which may lead to security risks.
    - The execution is subject to a weekly limit that resets soon.

    **Suggested next actions:**
    None

    **Validation evidence:**
    - The health monitor was started successfully with the specified settings.
    - The command is being executed as expected in a non-TTY environment.
