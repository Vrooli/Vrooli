    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    - **Working**: Mock API server fully operational with health checks, lifecycle management, and test suite
    - **Improved**: Jumped from 25% to 50% overall completion, 71% P0 requirements complete
    - **Quality**: 100% test coverage, 100% documentation, 100% v2.0 compliance

    ### Remaining Issues
    - Still in mock mode (not using real CrewAI library) - this is by design for Phase 1
    - Crew/Agent execution not yet implemented (planned for Phase 2)

    ### Validation Evidence
    - Health endpoint responding correctly: `{"status": "healthy"}`
    - All tests passing: smoke (5/5), integration (5/5), unit (4/4)
    - Service lifecycle working: start/stop/restart commands functional
    - Port registry integrated: using port 8084 from central registry
