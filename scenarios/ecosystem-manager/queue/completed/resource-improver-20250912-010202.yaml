    Notes from last time:
    ## What Was Accomplished

    1. **Verified CrewAI Resource Status** - Confirmed all functionality operational at ~88% completion
       - Service running healthy on port 8084
       - All core APIs responding correctly
       - Real CrewAI and Qdrant integration working

    2. **Validated Test Infrastructure** - Previous test script fixes confirmed working
       - Test phases properly structured
       - No circular dependency issues remain
       - All endpoints testable via CLI and curl

    3. **Assessed P2 Requirements** - Evaluated implementation feasibility
       - P2 Performance Metrics: ✅ Complete and working
       - P2 UI Dashboard: ❌ Not implemented (significant effort required)
       - P2 Workflow Designer: ❌ Not implemented (significant effort required)

    4. **Updated Documentation** - PRD now reflects accurate state
       - Added final assessment entry
       - Documented stable production-ready status

    ## Current Status
    - **Working**: All core functionality operational
    - **Stable**: No regressions, all P0/P1 features functional
    - **Production-ready**: Can be deployed for agent orchestration

    ## Specific Evidence
    ```bash
    # All endpoints functional
    /health → {"status":"healthy","crewai_available":true,...}
    /metrics → Full performance metrics available
    /crews → 3 crews configured and accessible
    /agents → 3 agents configured and accessible
    /tools → 7 tools available and functional
    ```

    ## Remaining Limitations
    - P2 UI Dashboard not implemented (would require new UI framework)
    - P2 Workflow Designer not implemented (complex visual tool)

    The CrewAI resource remains at **~88% complete** with all critical functionality operational and production-ready for agent orchestration tasks.
