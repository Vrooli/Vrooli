notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n1. **Fixed Critical Health Check Issues**:\n   - Fixed Ollama model detection to handle models with tags (e.g., `llama3.2:latest`)\n   - Fixed Qdrant health check endpoint from `/health` to `/readyz`\n   - Fixed Unstructured-io health check - corrected port (8000→11450) and endpoint to `/healthcheck`\n   - **Result**: All 5 dependencies now healthy (was 2/5 before)\n\n2. **Implemented Full AI Processing Pipeline**:\n   - Replaced demo mode with real Ollama integration\n   - Successfully extracts structured data from unstructured text\n   - Achieves 95% confidence scores on accurate extractions\n   - **Evidence**: Successfully processed contact text into structured JSON with all fields correctly extracted\n\n3. **Validated Core Functionality**:\n   - API running stable on dynamically allocated port\n   - 4 active schemas with 7 templates available\n   - PostgreSQL storage fully operational\n   - Health monitoring comprehensive with detailed metrics\n\n**Current status:**\nAll P0 requirements met. Scenario provides real value for data transformation with AI-powered extraction.\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Configure N8n workflows for orchestration (currently direct API calls work)\n- Complete unstructured-io integration for PDFs/images\n- Implement batch processing capabilities\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \nNone reported\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# Check health\ncurl -sf http://localhost:15774/health | jq\n\n# Process text data\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:15774/api/v1/process \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"schema_id\":\"[SCHEMA_ID]\",\"input_type\":\"text\",\"input_data\":\"[TEXT]\"}' | jq\n```"

Scenario provides real business value for data transformation.\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# Health check passing\ncurl -sf http://localhost:15774/health | jq '.status'\n# Result: \"healthy\"\n\n# Processing working with 95% confidence\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:15774/api/v1/process \\\n  -d '{\"schema_id\":\"...\",\"input_type\":\"text\",\"input_data\":\"Contact info...\"}' \\\n  | jq '.confidence_score'\n# Result: 0.95\n\n# CLI operational\nexport DATA_STRUCTURER_API_PORT=15774\n./cli/data-structurer list-schemas\n# Result: 4 schemas listed successfully\n```\n\n**Remaining limitations:**\n- N8n workflows not yet configured (placeholder files exist)\n- Batch processing not implemented (P1 requirement)\n- Legacy test format should migrate to phased testing\n- Minor test conflict (409 on duplicate schema name - cosmetic issue)\n"
