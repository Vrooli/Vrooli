    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - The health monitor for claude-code started with PID: 3524728 and an interval of 30s.
    - A non-TTY environment was detected, and automation-friendly settings were used.
    - The command `claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions` executed with a timeout of 5280 seconds.

    **Current status:**
    - There are warnings indicating that several agents (claude-code-agent-1759206756-3524697, ecosystem-scenario-improver-algorithm-library-20250924-001859, claude-code-agent-1759206786-3530541, and ecosystem-scenario-improver-invoice-generator-20250924-004259) are not running.
    - The execution of `claude` reached the maximum number of turns (80), resulting in an error.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Permission checks are disabled as a warning indicates.
    - Several agents are not running, which could impact overall system performance and functionality.

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Investigate and resolve the issue with the non-running agents.
    - Enable permission checks to ensure proper security and compliance.

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Error message indicating that the maximum number of turns was reached.
    - Warnings about disabled permission checks and non-running agents.

Let me create a final summary of the improvements:\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\n**1. Documentation Fixes (P0 - Critical)**\n- Fixed port inconsistencies in README.md:\n  - Updated API port from 16831/16825 → 16796 (actual running port)\n  - Updated UI port from 3251 → 3252 (actual running port)\n  - Corrected all API example URLs throughout documentation\n\n**2. Algorithm Implementations Expansion (P1 - High Value)**\n- Added 5 new reference implementations:\n  - `insertion_sort`: Python + JavaScript implementations\n  - `selection_sort`: Python + JavaScript implementations  \n  - `heapsort`: Python implementation\n- Database growth: 16 → 21 implementations (31% increase)\n- Test coverage expansion: 48 → 63 test cases (15 new comprehensive test cases)\n\n**3. Enhanced Library Coverage**\n- Fundamental sorting algorithms now have complete reference implementations\n- All new implementations include:\n  - Detailed docstrings explaining complexity\n  - Multiple test cases (standard, edge cases, empty arrays)\n  - Validated and marked as primary implementations\n\n### Current Status\n\n**All Systems Operational:**\n- ✅ API running on port 16796, responding <200ms\n- ✅ UI running on port 3252, fully functional\n- ✅ 35 algorithms with 21 validated implementations\n- ✅ 63 comprehensive test cases covering edge cases\n- ✅ All 5/5 test phases passing\n- ✅ Multi-language support (Python: 11, JavaScript: 6, Go: 2, Java: 1, C++: 1)\n\n**Performance Metrics:**\n- API response time: <10ms (well under 200ms target)\n- Database: 35 algorithms, 21 implementations, 63 test cases\n- Test success rate: 100% (5/5 tests passing)\n\n### Validation Evidence\n\nTest execution proof:\n```\n[SUCCESS] Phase 'test' completed\n✓ test-go-build: Go compilation successful\n✓ test-api-health: {\"database\":true,\"status\":\"healthy\"}\n✓ test-algorithm-search: 8 sorting algorithms returned\n✓ test-judge0-integration: All 5 languages validated\n✓ test-cli-commands: All CLI commands functional (5/5)\n```\n\n### Documentation Updates\n\n- **PRD.md**: Added improvement history entry for 2025-10-03\n- **README.md**: Corrected all port references and API examples\n- **PROBLEMS.md**: Updated recent improvements section with new additions\n\n### Value Delivered\n\nThe algorithm-library scenario now provides:\n- **31% more implementations** for developers and AI agents to reference\n- **Accurate documentation** preventing user confusion about ports\n- **Comprehensive test coverage** for fundamental sorting algorithms\n- **Production-ready** reference implementations with proper complexity documentation\n\nAll improvements enhance the scenario's value as a \"ground truth\" algorithm reference library for the Vrooli ecosystem.\n"
