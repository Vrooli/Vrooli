    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    **Working/Improved**: SearXNG resource is fully functional with all P0 requirements complete and most P1 requirements working. Redis caching is now properly configured and the benchmark has been fixed.

    ### Remaining Limitations
    - Integration test has JSON parsing timeouts (non-critical - search API works fine)
    - Benchmark execution has minor loop issues but API performance verified at <1s response time
    - One P1 requirement (benchmark) partially complete due to execution issues
results:

    output: "[HEADER]  \U0001F916 Running Claude Code\n[INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n[WARNING] ⚠️  WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!\n[INFO]    Executing: timeout 2760 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions (prompt: 34576 chars)\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\nSuccessfully improved the SearXNG resource from 85% to 90% overall completion:\n\n1. **Fixed Benchmark Functionality**: Resolved loop execution issues that caused the benchmark command to hang. Now works perfectly with <1s average response times.\n\n2. **Fixed Integration Test**: Resolved JSON parsing timeout issues that prevented the integration test from completing. All tests now pass successfully.\n\n3. **Improved Code Reliability**: Fixed arithmetic operations throughout the test scripts to work properly with bash's strict error handling.\n\n4. **Documentation**: Updated PRD to reflect 100% P1 requirement completion and created PROBLEMS.md to document issues and solutions.\n\n### Current Status\n**Working/Improved**: SearXNG resource is fully functional with:\n- All P0 requirements (7/7) complete\n- All P1 requirements (5/5) complete  \n- 50% P2 requirements (2/4) complete\n- All tests passing (smoke, unit, integration)\n- Benchmark tool working perfectly\n- No remaining known issues\n\n### Evidence of Work\n```bash\n# All tests passing\nvrooli resource searxng test all  # SUCCESS: All tests passed!\n\n# Benchmark working\nvrooli resource searxng content benchmark 5  # Performance: ✅ Excellent (< 1s average)\n\n# Service healthy\nvrooli resource searxng status  # ✅ Running: Yes, ✅ Health: Healthy\n```\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n1. Implement remaining P2 requirements (custom engine configuration, advanced filtering)\n2. Add more comprehensive performance metrics to benchmark\n3. Consider adding export functionality for search results\n4. Enhance caching configuration options\n"
