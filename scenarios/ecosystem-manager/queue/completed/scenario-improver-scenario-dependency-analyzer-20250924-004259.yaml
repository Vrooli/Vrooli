notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - 8/8 P0 requirements completed (100% complete)
    - Fixed graph command now accepts correct types (resource/scenario/combined)
    - Added optimize command for optimization recommendations
    - Enhanced propose command with better integration with AI analysis
    - Fixed CLI-API mapping for graph types
    - Added export formats for graphs (DOT and Mermaid)

    **Current status:**
    - Scenario-dependency-analyzer fully functional
    - P0 requirements working as expected
    - Dependency analyzer can analyze scenarios, generate graphs, propose dependencies, and provide optimization guidance

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Qdrant integration uses fallback heuristics (resource may not be running)
    - Optimize command shows preview/roadmap (full implementation pending)
    - Test suite has timing issues but functionality works
    - TODOs:
      - Implement proper resource client libraries vs exec calls
      - Add Redis caching for better performance
      - Implement circular dependency detection algorithm
      - Add historical tracking with database triggers

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Implement proper resource client libraries vs exec calls
    2. Add Redis caching for better performance
    3. Implement circular dependency detection algorithm
    4. Add historical tracking with database triggers

    **Validation evidence:**
    ```bash
    # CLI works
    ./cli/scenario-dependency-analyzer analyze chart-generator  # ✓ Returns 3 resources, 58 scenarios
    ./cli/scenario-dependency-analyzer graph --type combined    # ✓ Generates valid JSON graph
    ./cli/scenario-dependency-analyzer optimize ecosystem-manager # ✓ Shows optimization preview

    # API works
    curl http://localhost:15536/health  # ✓ Returns healthy status
    ```

Let me create a brief summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- ✅ Fixed critical port environment variable naming issue (was causing test failures)\n- ✅ Standardized all port references to use `API_PORT` and `UI_PORT` in service.json\n- ✅ Removed deprecated `DEPENDENCY_ANALYZER_API_PORT` variable from codebase\n- ✅ Updated all lifecycle test steps to use correct port variables\n- ✅ Rebuilt API binary with updated code\n- ✅ Verified all tests passing\n- ✅ Confirmed no remaining TODOs in codebase\n- ✅ Updated PRD to reflect current validated status (100% P0 complete)\n\n**Current status:**\n- Scenario-dependency-analyzer is **fully functional and validated**\n- All P0 requirements (8/8) are complete and tested\n- API health check: ✅ Healthy\n- Dependency analysis: ✅ Working (tested with chart-generator)\n- Graph generation: ✅ Working (1594 nodes, 262625 edges in combined graph)\n- CLI commands: ✅ Functional\n\n**Known limitations documented:**\n1. Qdrant integration uses fallback heuristics (acceptable - resource may not always be running)\n2. Optimization recommendations in preview mode (P1 - shows recommendations, doesn't auto-apply)\n3. Circular dependency detection not implemented (P1 requirement)\n4. Historical tracking pending (P1 requirement)\n5. Scenario name detection produces some false positives (detects common words - low priority improvement)\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# Health check\ncurl http://localhost:15533/health\n# Returns: {\"service\":\"scenario-dependency-analyzer\",\"status\":\"healthy\"}\n\n# Graph generation\ncurl http://localhost:15533/api/v1/graph/combined | jq '{nodes: (.nodes | length), edges: (.edges | length)}'\n# Returns: {\"nodes\": 1594, \"edges\": 262625}\n```\n\nThe scenario has been successfully validated and tidied. All critical issues have been resolved.\n"
