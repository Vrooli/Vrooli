    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Validated External Sync Implementation - All external calendar sync components are properly implemented:
      - Database tables created successfully (external_calendars, oauth_states, external_sync_log, external_event_mappings)
      - API endpoints functioning correctly on port 19912
      - OAuth flow initiation working with mock providers
      - Manual sync trigger functioning
      - Background sync processor configured for 15-minute intervals
      - CLI commands present (sync connect, disconnect, status, run)

    - Test Suite Validation - Tests passing successfully:
      - All 5 test phases completed
      - API health, event creation, listing all working
      - Dynamic timestamps prevent duplicate conflicts
      - 139 events in database showing active usage

    - Documentation Updated:
      - Updated PROBLEMS.md with external sync implementation status
      - Added detailed notes about OAuth requirements for production

    - UI Verification - Screenshot captured successfully showing UI running on port 35941

    **Current status:**
    - Feature-Complete Calendar System - All core features operational
    - External sync fully implemented with mock OAuth for development
    - API running on port 19912 (not 36301 as initially expected)
    - 100% P0 requirements complete (9/9)
    - 100% P1 requirements complete (8/8)
    - 83% P2 requirements complete (5/6 - only voice activation pending)
    - Health status: Degraded (auth service connection issue only - non-critical)
    - Security audit: 8 vulnerabilities, 947 standards violations (mostly style issues)

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - API port discovery showed service running on 19912 instead of configured 36301
    - Auth service degradation is non-critical but should be resolved

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Resolve auth service issue and ensure API runs on correct port
    - Complete voice activation feature for P2 requirements
    - Address security audit findings, particularly style issues and vulnerabilities

    **Validation evidence:**
    - ✅ External sync status endpoint: `{"connections": null}` (no connections but endpoint works)
    - ✅ OAuth initiation: Returns mock auth URL with state token
    - ✅ Manual sync trigger: Returns `{"success": true}`
    - ✅ Health endpoint accessible and responsive
    - ✅ UI screenshot captured at `/tmp/calendar-ui-2025-09-30.png`
    - ✅ 139 active events in database
    - ✅ Tests passing with proper lifecycle management
