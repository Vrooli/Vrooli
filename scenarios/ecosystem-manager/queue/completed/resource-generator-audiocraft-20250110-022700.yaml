notes: '- **What it does:** Meta''s comprehensive audio generation framework featuring MusicGen for text-to-music, AudioGen for sound effects, and EnCodec for neural audio compression. Supports melody-guided generation and provides multiple pre-trained models from 300M to 1.5B parameters. - **Use when:** Scenarios need music generation, sound effect creation, audio compression, or creative audio content production. Perfect for game development, content creation platforms, and multimedia applications requiring dynamic audio. - **Technical requirements:** - Python 3.9+ with PyTorch 2.1.0 - GPU recommended for real-time generation - 20,000 hours training data models - MIT licensed code, CC-BY-NC 4.0 weights - Hugging Face integration available'
