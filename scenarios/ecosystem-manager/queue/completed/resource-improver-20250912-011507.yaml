notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Thoroughly validated the neo4j resource and confirmed it is **99% production-ready** with one minor issue:\n  - All core functionality works perfectly (PRD Status): P0 (7/7), P1 (4/4), P2 (3/3) \n  - v2.0 Contract Compliance: fully compliant with all required files and commands\n  - Test Validation: 100% pass rate (16/16 tests) - smoke, integration, and unit tests all passing\n  - Performance Verified: health check response <10ms, restart functionality works smoothly\n\n**Current status:**\nWORKING - 99% Production Ready: Neo4j v5.15.0 Community Edition fully operational. Only the APOC plugin auto-installation needs a URL fix.\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n1. **APOC Installation Bug**: The `install-apoc` command fails because it uses incorrect URL pattern:\n   - Current (broken): `https://github.com/neo4j/apoc/releases/download/2025.09.0/apoc-2025.09.0-core.jar`\n   - Correct pattern: `https://github.com/neo4j/apoc/releases/download/5.15.0/apoc-5.15.0-core.jar`\n   - The function in `core.sh:34` uses a non-existent version \"2025.09.0\" instead of matching Neo4j version\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n1. Fix APOC installation URL in `lib/core.sh:34` to use Neo4j-compatible version (5.15.0)\n2. Consider adding a fallback mechanism for APOC download failures\n3. The resource is otherwise production-ready and requires no other improvements\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\nvrooli resource neo4j test all         # 100% pass rate (16/16)\nvrooli resource neo4j status           # Healthy, v5.15.0 running\nvrooli resource neo4j credentials      # Connection details work\nvrooli resource neo4j content metrics  # Returns performance data\nvrooli resource neo4j content execute  # Cypher queries work\nvrooli resource neo4j content backup   # Creates backups (JSON format)\nvrooli resource neo4j manage restart   # Lifecycle commands work\n```"

APOC 5.26.12 installs correctly and provides enhanced graph capabilities.\n2. **No Regressions Introduced**: All existing functionality preserved and validated through comprehensive testing.\n3. **Documentation Accurate**: PRD and PROBLEMS.md updated to reflect the current production-ready state.\n\nThe neo4j resource is now 100% production-ready with no remaining issues.\n"
