    Already pretty good, but could probably benefit from some validation/tidying.

    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    - **Working**: Resource fully operational
    - **PRD**: 100% complete (all requirements implemented and validated)
    - **Tests**: All passing
    - **Quality**: Code tidied and improved

    ### Specific Evidence
    ```bash
    # All tests pass
    vrooli resource neo4j test all  # ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

    # Health check responds quickly
    timeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:7474/health  # ✅ Healthy

    # Ports properly configured from registry
    grep "RESOURCE_PORTS" resources/neo4j/config/defaults.sh  # Uses standard array
    ```

    ### Lessons Learned
    - Always use the standardized port registry patterns rather than direct file parsing
    - Fix shellcheck warnings to prevent potential bugs and improve code quality
    - Test after every change to ensure no regressions

    The neo4j resource is now cleaner, more maintainable, and follows best practices while maintaining 100% functionality.
