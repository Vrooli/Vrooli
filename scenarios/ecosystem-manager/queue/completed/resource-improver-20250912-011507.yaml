    Notes from last time:
    ### What Was Accomplished
    Successfully improved the neo4j resource with focus on code quality and validation:

    1. **Fixed all shellcheck warnings**:
       - Resolved all SC2155 warnings by separating variable declarations from assignments
       - Fixed SC2034 warning by removing unused variables
       - Improved overall code quality and bash scripting patterns

    2. **Enhanced backup functionality**:
       - Fixed backup to work with authentication set to "none"
       - Improved error handling and directory creation
       - Added better fallback for when APOC is not available

    3. **Validated all functionality**:
       - All tests pass (100% smoke, integration, unit)
       - Performance monitoring works correctly
       - Health checks respond quickly (<1 second)
       - No regressions introduced

    ### Current Status
    - **Working**: Resource fully operational with improved code quality
    - **Improved**: Code is cleaner and more maintainable
    - **Tests**: All passing with no regressions

    ### Specific Evidence
    ```bash
    # All tests pass
    vrooli resource neo4j test all  # ✅ ALL TESTS PASSED

    # Backup now works
    vrooli resource neo4j content backup test_backup  # ✅ Success

    # No more SC2155 warnings
    shellcheck lib/core.sh | grep -c SC2155  # Result: 0
    ```

    ### Lessons Learned
    - Separating variable declaration from assignment (SC2155) prevents masking of return values
    - Testing after every change ensures no regressions
    - Backup functions need to handle different authentication modes gracefully
    - Small, incremental improvements maintain stability while enhancing quality

    The neo4j resource is now more robust, maintainable, and follows bash best practices while preserving 100% functionality.
