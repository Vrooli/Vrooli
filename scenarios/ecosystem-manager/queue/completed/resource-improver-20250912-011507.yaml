notes: "Notes from last time:\n### Current Status\n- **Working**: Resource is fully functional with v2.0 contract compliance\n- **P0 Completion**: 100% (7/7 requirements) ✅\n- **P1 Completion**: 100% (4/4 requirements) ✅  \n- **Overall Progress**: 78% complete\n\n### Evidence of Validation\n```bash\n# All tests passing:\n✅ Smoke tests: 100% (4/4)\n✅ Integration tests: 100% (6/6)\n✅ Unit tests: 100% (4/4)\n```\n\n### Specific Test Commands\n```bash\n# Performance monitoring works:\nvrooli resource neo4j content metrics\nvrooli resource neo4j content monitor \"MATCH (n) RETURN count(n)\"\n\n# Backup/restore works:\nvrooli resource neo4j content backup\nvrooli resource neo4j content restore <backup-file>\n\n# All tests pass:\n./test/run-tests.sh all\n```\n\n### Remaining Limitations\nAll P1 requirements are now complete. Only P2 requirements remain:\n- Clustering support (P2)\n- Advanced analytics/graph algorithms (P2)\n- Real-time subscriptions via WebSocket (P2)"
