    Notes from last time:
    ### What Was Accomplished

    1. **✅ Implemented Comprehensive Audit Logging (Security Requirement)**
       - Created `lib/audit.sh` with full audit trail capabilities
       - Integrated audit logging into all SMS operations
       - Tracks who, what, when, where, why for every operation
       - Tamper-resistant monthly audit files with proper permissions
       - Search, statistics, and archival capabilities
       - Integration with system logger for centralized logging

    2. **✅ Implemented Analytics Dashboard (P2 Requirement)**
       - Created `lib/analytics.sh` with complete analytics functionality
       - Real-time dashboard with period filtering (today/week/month/all)
       - Cost analysis with per-segment calculation
       - Top recipients and hourly distribution charts
       - Performance metrics and delivery status breakdown
       - Export capabilities for reports

    3. **✅ Enhanced CLI Interface**
       - Added 7 new commands for audit and analytics
       - Integrated new libraries into CLI framework
       - Maintained backward compatibility

    ### Current Status
    - **Working**: All existing functionality preserved and enhanced
    - **Tests**: All tests passing (smoke, unit, integration)
    - **PRD Progress**: 77% → 85% complete
    - **Security**: All security requirements now met
    - **P2 Progress**: 1 of 3 P2 requirements completed

    ### Specific Evidence of Work

    **Test Results**:
    ```
    ✅ Smoke tests: PASSED (4/4)
    ✅ Unit tests: PASSED (5/5)
    ✅ Integration tests: PASSED (7/7)
    ```

    **New Commands Available**:
    - `content audit-search` - Search audit logs
    - `content audit-stats` - Show audit statistics
    - `content audit-archive` - Archive old audit logs
    - `content dashboard` - Show analytics dashboard
    - `content analytics-export` - Export analytics report
    - `content analytics-costs` - Show daily cost breakdown
    - `content analytics-performance` - Show performance metrics

    ### Remaining Work (P2 Requirements)
    - Voice Calls implementation
    - WhatsApp Integration

    ### Lessons Learned
    - The Twilio resource was already well-structured with good test coverage
    - Adding audit logging required integration at multiple points but the existing architecture made it straightforward
    - Analytics features leverage existing message history data effectively
    - The v2.0 CLI framework makes adding new commands simple and consistent
