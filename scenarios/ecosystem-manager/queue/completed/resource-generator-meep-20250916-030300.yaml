title: MEEP Electromagnetic Simulation Engine
type: resource
operation: generator
category: science
priority: high
effort_estimate: 10h
urgency: medium
impact_score: 8
requirements:
    P0:
        - Package MEEP with its Python bindings and MPB dependencies into a Docker image that supports CPU/GPU execution and seed canonical photonics tutorials.
        - Provide CLI commands to run FDTD simulations headlessly, sweep parameters, and export field data to HDF5/VTK for analysis by other resources.
        - Add smoke tests that execute a sample waveguide case, verify transmission spectra, and persist results into MinIO/Postgres.
    P1:
        - Implement adapters to stream simulation outputs into QuestDB/Qdrant for search/analytics and render summaries through Superset or Blender visualizations.
        - Document co-design workflows connecting MEEP with OpenEMS, Elmer, and Windmill automation for coupled EM/thermal studies.
        - Provide batch experimentation templates that capture provenance and enable ecosystem agents to compare device variants programmatically.
    P2:
        - Enable optional GPU acceleration profiles (CUDA/OpenCL) and HPC scheduling manifests for large photonics studies.
        - Offer integration hooks for reinforcement-learning or Bayesian optimization loops via CrewAI/Ollama orchestrations.
        - Publish patterns for embedding validated EM components into the tech-tree knowledge graph with searchable metadata.
