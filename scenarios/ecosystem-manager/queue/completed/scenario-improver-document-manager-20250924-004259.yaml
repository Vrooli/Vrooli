notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Successfully improved the document-manager scenario to achieve 100% P0 requirement completion\n- Fixed API Issues:\n  - Agent creation handles JSONB config fields properly\n  - Improvement queue correctly manages timestamp fields\n  - All CRUD operations tested and working\n- Database Integration:\n  - PostgreSQL fully connected and functional\n  - All tables created and verified\n- Core Features Verified:\n  - Application management (CRUD) \n  - Agent management\n  - Improvement queue\n  - UI running on port 37923\n  - API health check < 500ms\n\n**Current status:**\n- Working: All P0 requirements fully functional\n- API: Running on dynamic port with health check\n- UI: Accessible and healthy\n- Database: Connected with all schema applied\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Qdrant vector database connectivity issue (P1 requirement, non-critical)\n- Some resource dependencies not auto-starting\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n1. Resolve Qdrant connectivity for vector search capabilities\n2. Implement P1 requirements for enhanced functionality\n3. Add comprehensive integration tests\n4. Improve resource dependency management\n\n**Validation evidence:**\nTest Commands for Validation:\n```bash\n# API Health\ncurl -sf http://localhost:17789/health\n\n# Create Application\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:17789/api/applications \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Test App\", \"repository_url\": \"https://github.com/test/repo\"}'\n\n# Create Agent  \ncurl -X POST http://localhost:17789/api/agents \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"name\": \"Test Agent\", \"type\": \"drift_detector\", \"application_id\": \"APP_ID\"}'\n\n# UI Health\ncurl -sf http://localhost:37923/ui-health\n```"
