notes: '- **What it does:** Modern, lightweight VPN protocol providing secure point-to-point connections with state-of-the-art cryptography. Creates encrypted tunnels between distributed resources. - **Use when:** Resources need secure communication across different networks, remote access to local resources, or creating isolated network namespaces for containers. Essential for distributed deployments. - **Technical requirements:** - Linux kernel module or userspace implementation - Public key infrastructure setup - IP forwarding and NAT configuration - Firewall rules for port 51820 (default) - Network namespace support for isolation'
