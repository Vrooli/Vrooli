title: OpenRocket Launch Vehicle Design Studio
type: resource
operation: generator
category: aerospace
priority: high
effort_estimate: 6h
urgency: medium
impact_score: 8
requirements:
    P0:
        - Containerize OpenRocket with headless simulation capabilities and seed sample rocket designs plus atmosphere models.
        - Expose CLI commands to import/export .ork designs, run trajectory simulations, and export flight logs for downstream analytics.
        - Add smoke tests that simulate the default example, verify launch metrics, and persist outputs into MinIO/Postgres for reuse.
    P1:
        - Document workflows linking OpenRocket geometry to SU2 and Blender for high-fidelity CFD and visualization pipelines.
        - Provide automation templates that sync simulated telemetry with OpenMCT dashboards and QuestDB timeseries.
        - Implement parameter sweep helpers for optimizing staging, mass distribution, and recovery strategies with captured metadata.
    P2:
        - Enable hooks for integrating real telemetry (Traccar/OpenTAK) so scenarios can compare simulated vs. observed flights.
        - Offer mission planning templates that couple OpenRocket results with OpenTripPlanner or GeoNode layers for range safety analyses.
        - Publish knowledge-base entries so vetted designs become reusable tech-tree building blocks for autonomous agents.
