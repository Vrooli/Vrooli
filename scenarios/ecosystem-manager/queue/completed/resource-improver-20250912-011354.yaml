    Already pretty good, but could benefit from additional validation/tidying.

    Notes from last time:
    ### Validation Results
    **Status: 100% Complete - Fully Verified** ✅

    The Huginn resource has been thoroughly validated and confirmed to be at 100% completion with all requirements met:

    ### Verification Evidence
    1. **All v2.0 Contract Files Present**: cli.sh, lib/core.sh, lib/test.sh, config files, test structure
    2. **All Tests Passing**: Smoke (0s), Integration (2s), Unit (0s) - 100% pass rate
    3. **All PRD Requirements Complete**: 14/14 requirements checked (P0: 7/7, P1: 4/4, P2: 3/3)
    4. **Service Running Stably**: Container healthy after 38+ hours continuous operation
    5. **All Features Functional**:
       - Native API working (17 agents, 3 scenarios, 2 users)
       - Multi-tenant support operational (demo tenant exists)
       - Ollama AI integration tested successfully
       - Performance metrics collecting properly
       - Health checks responding in <200ms

    ### No Issues Found
    - No broken functionality detected
    - No missing requirements identified
    - No documentation inaccuracies found
    - No configuration problems discovered
    - All commands working as documented (28 available commands)

    ### Minor Observations (Non-Issues)
    - MySQL deprecation warnings in logs (from upstream Huginn, not blocking functionality)
    - These are cosmetic and don't affect operations

    ### Conclusion
    The Huginn resource is production-ready and fully operational at 100% completion. No improvements or fixes are needed at this time. The resource exceeds all requirements and performs reliably.
