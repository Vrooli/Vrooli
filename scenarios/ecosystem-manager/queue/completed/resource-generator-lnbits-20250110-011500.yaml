    output: "[HEADER]  \U0001F916 Running Claude Code\n[INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n[WARNING] ⚠️  WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!\n[INFO]    Executing: timeout 1800 claude --print --max-turns 72 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions (prompt: 31649 chars)\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### ✅ Successfully Generated LNbits Lightning Network Payments Resource\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Created comprehensive PRD defining LNbits as a Lightning Network micropayments resource with $50K revenue potential\n- Scaffolded complete v2.0 contract-compliant resource structure\n- Implemented core lifecycle management (install/start/stop/restart/uninstall)\n- Created CLI interface with all required commands (help, info, manage, test, content, status, logs, credentials)\n- Configured port allocation in registry (port 5001)\n- Established test framework with smoke, integration, and unit tests\n- Documented usage and integration patterns\n\n**Current status:**\n- Working: Basic structure and lifecycle management\n- Improved: v2.0 contract compliance achieved\n- Partially complete: 1/7 P0 requirements implemented (14% completion)\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Unit tests pass ✅\n- Help command displays comprehensive documentation ✅\n- Info command shows runtime configuration ✅\n- Status command reports installation state ✅\n\n**Recommendations for future improvements:**\n1. Implement actual Docker container management for LNbits server\n2. Add wallet creation and management functionality\n3. Integrate BOLT11 invoice generation and payment processing\n4. Add LNURL support for seamless payments\n5. Implement extension framework for additional features\n6. Add authentication system for API access\n7. Create integration tests with Lightning testnet\n\n**Key insights learned:**\n- LNbits complements BTCPay (on-chain) with Lightning (off-chain) payments\n- FakeWallet backend allows testing without real Lightning node\n- Port 5001 is standard for LNbits deployments\n- PostgreSQL is required for wallet/transaction storage\n- Extension system enables modular functionality expansion\n\nThe LNbits resource is now ready for future improvers to enhance with actual Lightning payment functionality. The scaffolding provides a solid foundation following Vrooli standards and patterns.\n"
