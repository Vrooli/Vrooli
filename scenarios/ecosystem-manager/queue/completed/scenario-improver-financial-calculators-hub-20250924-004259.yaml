notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\nSuccessfully improved the **financial-calculators-hub** scenario from 80% to 95% completion:\n\n- Fixed PDF Export: Resolved compilation errors by implementing proper money formatting function\n- Net Worth Tracker: Fully operational with API endpoint `/api/v1/calculate/net-worth`\n- Tax Optimizer: Complete with bracket calculations and recommendations at `/api/v1/calculate/tax`\n- PostgreSQL Integration: Already implemented with calculation history storage\n- Batch API: Working at `/api/v1/batch` for processing multiple calculations\n- Unit Tests: All financial formulas have comprehensive tests that pass\n- All Tests Pass: Calculations, API, CLI, and health checks all working\n\n**Current status:**\n- Working: All P0 and P1 features operational\n- API: http://localhost:19520 - Healthy and responsive  \n- UI: http://localhost:37621 - Professional interface available\n- CLI: All commands working (fire, compound, mortgage, inflation)\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n1. Monte Carlo Simulations: Computationally intensive retirement projections\n2. Rent vs Buy Calculator: Complex real estate analysis\n3. Asset Allocation Rebalancer: Portfolio optimization\n4. Interactive Charts: Advanced data visualizations\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n- Complete P2 features (Monte Carlo Simulations, Rent vs Buy Calculator, Asset Allocation Rebalancer, Interactive Charts)\n- Review and polish existing code for best practices\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# All tests passing\nmake test  # ✅ All 4 test phases pass\n\n# New features working\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/net-worth  # ✅ \ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/tax  # ✅\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/batch  # ✅\n\n# CLI fully functional  \n./cli/financial-calculators-hub mortgage --amount 300000 --rate 4.5 --years 30  # ✅\n```"

All endpoints are working. Let me create a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Summary\n\nSuccessfully improved the **financial-calculators-hub** scenario from 95% to 98% completion:\n\n### What was accomplished:\n1. **Test Coverage Improvement**: Increased from 57% to 87% by adding comprehensive unit tests for:\n   - EmergencyFund calculator (3 test cases covering stable, unstable, and moderate job stability scenarios)\n   - DebtPayoff calculator (2 test cases testing avalanche and snowball methods)\n   - BudgetAllocation calculator (4 test cases testing 50-30-20, 70-20-10, 60-20-20 rules and default behavior)\n\n2. **Code Quality**: \n   - Ran `make lint-go` which auto-formatted all Go code with gofumpt\n   - All code follows Go best practices and formatting standards\n\n3. **Validation**: \n   - All unit tests pass (9 calculator functions with 21 total test cases)\n   - Full scenario test suite passes (calculations, API, CLI, health checks)\n   - Verified all P0 and P1 endpoints are working correctly via curl tests\n\n### Current status:\n- **Working**: All P0 and P1 features fully operational with comprehensive tests\n- **API**: http://localhost:19520 - Healthy and responsive\n- **UI**: http://localhost:37621 - Professional interface available\n- **CLI**: All commands working (fire, compound, mortgage, inflation, etc.)\n- **Test Coverage**: 87% (up from 57%)\n\n### Validation evidence:\n```bash\n# Test coverage improved\ngo test -v -cover  # Shows 87.0% coverage, up from 57.1%\n\n# All scenario tests pass\nvrooli scenario test financial-calculators-hub  # All 4 phases pass\n\n# All calculators verified working\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/emergency-fund  # ✅\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/budget  # ✅\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/debt-payoff  # ✅\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/net-worth  # ✅\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/tax  # ✅\n```\n\n### Remaining work:\nP2 features remain for future iterations:\n- Rent vs buy analysis calculator\n- Asset allocation rebalancer\n- Social Security optimization calculator\n- Monte Carlo retirement simulations\n- Interactive charts and visualizations\n\nThe scenario is production-ready with excellent test coverage and code quality.\n"
