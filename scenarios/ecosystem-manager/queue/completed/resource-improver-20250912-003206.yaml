    Already pretty good allegedly, but could benefit from additional validation/testing.

    Notes from last time:
    ## Improvements Made to OBS Studio Resource

    ### Key Enhancements
    1. **Dependency Management** - Added automatic installation of obs-websocket-py Python library
    2. **Error Handling** - Fixed MOCK_MODE variable initialization issues in audio.sh and transitions.sh
    3. **Graceful Fallback** - Python code now handles missing dependencies gracefully with mock data
    4. **Reliability** - All features now work correctly in both real and mock modes

    ### Specific Fixes
    - ✅ Added Python dependency installation to obs::install() function
    - ✅ Fixed unbound MOCK_MODE variable errors in audio and transitions modules
    - ✅ Added try/except blocks for obswebsocket imports with fallback behavior
    - ✅ Updated README with new improvements
    - ✅ Updated PRD with progress history

    ### Validation
    - All tests pass successfully (smoke, unit, integration)
    - Audio mixer commands work correctly
    - Transitions commands work correctly
    - Graceful degradation when dependencies are missing

    ### Current Status
    ✅ **100% Complete** - OBS Studio resource is fully functional with all P0, P1, and P2 features implemented and validated. The resource now includes improved reliability and error handling for production use.
