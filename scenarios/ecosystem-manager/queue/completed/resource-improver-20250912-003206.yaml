notes: "Already pretty good allegedly, but could benefit from additional validation/testing.\n\nNotes from last time:\n### Current Status\n✅ **Successfully Completed** - The obs-studio resource is now at 100% completion with all P2 features implemented.\n\n### Specific Evidence\n```bash\n# All tests pass\nvrooli resource obs-studio test all  # ✅ All phases pass\n\n# Audio mixer commands available\nvrooli resource obs-studio audio status  # Shows comprehensive audio status\nvrooli resource obs-studio audio list    # Lists all audio sources\n\n# Transition effects commands available  \nvrooli resource obs-studio transitions list     # Shows all transitions\nvrooli resource obs-studio transitions current  # Shows current settings\n```\n\n### Key Improvements (PRD Progress: 99% → 100%)\n1. **Advanced Audio Mixer Control** - Complete audio management with 13 subcommands\n   - Volume, mute/unmute, monitoring, balance, sync offset controls\n   - Audio filters, ducking, compression, noise suppression, EQ\n2. **Transition Effects** - Full transition management with 9 subcommands\n   - Support for cut, fade, swipe, slide, stinger, luma wipe transitions\n   - Custom transition creation and library management\n3. **Comprehensive Examples** - Added workflow examples for both features\n4. **Full CLI Integration** - All commands properly integrated with CLI framework\n5. **Mock Mode Support** - All new features work in mock mode for testing\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n- ✅ Created audio mixer module (lib/audio.sh) with 13 subcommands\n- ✅ Created transitions module (lib/transitions.sh) with 9 subcommands  \n- ✅ Integrated both modules into CLI with proper command handlers\n- ✅ Added comprehensive workflow examples\n- ✅ Updated PRD to 100% completion\n- ✅ Updated README with new feature documentation\n- ✅ All tests pass with no regressions\n\n### Resource is Now Feature Complete\nAll requirements from the PRD are now implemented:\n- P0 (Must Have): 100% complete\n- P1 (Should Have): 100% complete  \n- P2 (Nice to Have): 100% complete"
