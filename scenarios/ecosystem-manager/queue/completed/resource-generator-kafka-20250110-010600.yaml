notes: '- **What it does:** Industry-standard distributed event streaming platform for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable messaging. Acts as a durable, high-speed pipeline between data producers and consumers. - **Use when:** Scenarios need real-time event streaming, message queuing at scale, log aggregation, or building event-driven microservices. Essential for guaranteed message delivery. - **Technical requirements:** - Java 8+ runtime environment - KRaft mode (3.3+) eliminates Zookeeper dependency - Native Docker image (apache/kafka) - Persistent storage for log segments - Network configuration for broker communication'
