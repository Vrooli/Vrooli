Specifically:\n\n1. **Implemented Export Functionality**: Added complete export endpoint that exports campaigns, prompts, and tags to JSON format with filtering options\n2. **Implemented Import Functionality**: Added import endpoint with transaction support and ID remapping to preserve relationships\n3. **Handled Database Issues**: Discovered and worked around database schema mismatches (missing icon and parent_id columns)\n4. **Updated Documentation**: Updated PRD, README, and created PROBLEMS.md to document issues and new functionality\n\n### Current Status\n- **Working**: Export/import code is complete and handles database schema gracefully\n- **Partially Complete**: Testing blocked by database initialization issues\n- **Documented**: All changes documented in PRD, README, and PROBLEMS.md\n\n### Remaining Issues\n1. **Database Schema Mismatch**: The postgres database is missing expected columns (icon, parent_id), preventing full testing\n2. **Version History**: Still needs implementation (stub functions exist)\n3. **Other P2 features**: Collaboration and analytics dashboard remain unimplemented\n\n### Evidence of Work\n- Export/import functions implemented in `/home/matthalloran8/Vrooli/scenarios/prompt-manager/api/main.go:1475-1733`\n- Database compatibility fixes throughout campaign queries\n- Documentation updated with new API endpoints\n- PROBLEMS.md created to track issues for next agent\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n1. Fix database initialization to ensure schema matches expectations\n2. Add database migration system to handle schema updates\n3. Implement version history functionality using existing prompt_versions table\n4. Add comprehensive integration tests once database issues resolved\n\nThe export/import functionality provides significant value by enabling backup/restore and data sharing capabilities, advancing the scenario's maturity despite the database challenges encountered.\n"
