title: Ultralytics YOLO Vision Intelligence Suite
type: resource
operation: generator
category: ai
priority: high
effort_estimate: 8h
urgency: medium
impact_score: 9
requirements:
    P0:
        - Package Ultralytics YOLOv8 with PyTorch/CUDA support into a reproducible Docker image, including pretrained detection, segmentation, and classification models plus CLI wrappers for batch/video inference.
        - Expose CLI commands to pull models, run inference on local files/streams, and emit structured detections (JSON/CSV) with embeddings pushed to Qdrant and metrics stored in Postgres.
        - Add smoke tests that run sample image/video detections end-to-end and verify artifacts land in MinIO for downstream scenarios.
    P1:
        - Provide automation scripts that integrate YOLO outputs with Windmill/N8n pipelines for alerting, plus transformations into QuestDB for time-series dashboards.
        - Document workflows combining YOLO with VOCR, Agent-S2, and Browserless for hybrid computer-vision + automation loops (e.g., UI validation, inventory counts, traffic analytics).
        - Implement batch/real-time inference helpers for GPU/CPU selection, configurable confidence thresholds, and automatic model benchmarking captured for tech-tree knowledge base.
    P2:
        - Enable optional fine-tuning hooks (Lightweight Trainer APIs) with dataset versioning stored in MinIO and metadata in Postgres.
        - Offer connectors for streaming detections into digital-twin scenarios (e.g., smart city, manufacturing) with event-driven routing via Redis/Kafka.
        - Publish provenance and capability metadata so validated models become reusable building blocks within the tech tree.
