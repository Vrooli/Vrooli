notes: "Notes from last time:\n### What Was Accomplished\nSuccessfully improved the SageMath resource from 60% to 80% completion by implementing all P1 requirements:\n\n1. **Fixed Performance Benchmarks** - Now completes reliably with timeouts and optimized operations\n2. **Enhanced Visualization Capabilities** - Plots automatically save to PNG files  \n3. **Fixed Test Library Issues** - Resolved missing imports that caused test failures\n\n### Current Status\n- **Working**: All P0 and P1 requirements fully functional\n- **Improved**: Performance tests, visualization, test reliability\n- **Status**: 80% complete (8/10 requirements)\n\n### Validation Evidence\n```bash\n# All tests passing\nvrooli resource sagemath test all  # SUCCESS\n\n# Performance benchmarks work\nresource-sagemath test performance  # Completes in <10s\n\n# Visualization generates files\nresource-sagemath content calculate \"plot(sin(x), x, -pi, pi)\"\n# Creates: /data/resources/sagemath/outputs/plot_*.png\n```\n\n### Remaining Limitations\n- P2 requirements (GPU acceleration, distributed computing) remain unimplemented as they require infrastructure changes beyond the scope of this improvement task"
