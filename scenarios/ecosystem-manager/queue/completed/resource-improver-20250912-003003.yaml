notes: "Not sure current status. Likely already pretty good, but could benefit from additional validation/tidying. \n\nNotes from last time:\n### Verified Complete\n- **Resource Status**: SageMath is fully operational and healthy\n- **PRD Accuracy**: All checkboxes validated - 100% completion (10/10 requirements)\n- **Test Coverage**: All tests pass (smoke, unit, integration, performance)\n- **v2.0 Compliance**: Full contract compliance verified\n\n### Improvements Made\n- **Port Registry Integration**: Added sagemath to centralized port registry and updated configuration to use it\n- **Documentation**: Updated IMPROVEMENTS.md with latest changes\n\n### Validation Evidence\n```bash\nvrooli resource sagemath test all  # All tests pass\nvrooli resource sagemath status    # Shows healthy status\nvrooli resource sagemath content create test --template calculus  # Feature works\n```\n\n### Current State\n- **Status**: Working/Enhanced\n- **Key Features**: All P0, P1, and P2 requirements functional\n- **Notable Capabilities**: GPU detection, parallel computing, export formats, notebook creation\n\n### Net Progress\n- Added: 1 improvement (port registry integration)\n- Broken: 0 features\n- Net: +1 improvement\n\nThe SageMath resource is **fully functional and enhanced** with 100% PRD completion and improved port management through centralized registry integration."
