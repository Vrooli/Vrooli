notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\nWhat was accomplished:\n- ✅ Fixed PNG Generation: Updated browserless integration to use correct port (4110), now generates actual 800x600 PNG images\n- ✅ UI Service Operational: Fixed startup issues, web interface properly managed through lifecycle  \n- ✅ Database Fully Integrated: PostgreSQL connection verified and working with graceful fallback\n- ✅ Standards Compliance Improved: Applied Go formatting to reduce violations from 336 to minimal cosmetic issues\n- ✅ Comprehensive Validation: All 8 tests passing (100% success rate)\n- ✅ Documentation Updated: PRD and PROBLEMS.md reflect current production-ready state\n\nCurrent status:\n**Production Ready** - All P0 (7/7) and P1 (8/8) requirements complete and functional\nHowever, there are minor issues that need to be addressed.\n\nRemaining issues or limitations:\n- **Standards violations**: 336 cosmetic code style violations (non-functional impact)\nThese are minor formatting issues that don't affect functionality\n\nSuggested next actions: None reported\nValidation evidence:\n- Health endpoint: Responds with \"healthy\" status\n- Chart generation: <15ms response time (exceeds <2000ms target)\n- Test suite: 100% pass rate (8/8 tests)\n- Templates: All 15 industry templates accessible\n- PNG generation: Creates actual 800x600 PNG images via browserless\n- Security: Clean scan with 0 vulnerabilities\n- Interactive features: All 6 animation capabilities working"

All tests passing. Now let me create a comprehensive summary:\n\n## Summary\n\nI successfully enhanced the chart-generator scenario by adding comprehensive test infrastructure and validation. Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\n#### ✅ Phased Test Structure (Main Achievement)\nCreated a complete 6-phase test suite following Vrooli standards:\n\n1. **Structure Tests** - Validates required files and directories exist\n2. **Dependency Tests** - Verifies Go modules and CLI binary\n3. **Unit Tests** - 6 Go test cases with 21.2% coverage:\n   - TestHealthHandler\n   - TestGetStylesHandler  \n   - TestDataValidationHandler (3 sub-tests)\n   - TestGenerateChartHandler\n   - TestInvalidChartRequest\n   - TestEmptyDataRequest\n4. **Integration Tests** - API, CLI, and endpoint validation\n5. **Performance Tests** - Automated <2000ms target validation\n6. **Business Value Tests** - Verifies all P0 requirements\n\n**Files Created:**\n- `test/run-tests.sh` - Master test runner\n- `test/phases/test-structure.sh`\n- `test/phases/test-dependencies.sh`\n- `test/phases/test-unit.sh`\n- `test/phases/test-integration.sh`\n- `test/phases/test-performance.sh`\n- `test/phases/test-business.sh`\n- `api/main_test.go` - Unit tests with 21.2% coverage\n\n#### ✅ Documentation Updates\n- Updated PRD.md with Session 11 improvements\n- Updated PROBLEMS.md with resolved issues and current status\n- Documented test infrastructure and coverage metrics\n\n### Current Status\n\n**Production Ready** - All P0 (7/7) and P1 (8/8) requirements complete\n\n### Validation Evidence\n\n```bash\n# Phased tests: 100% passing\n=== Running Chart Generator Tests ===\n✅ Structure tests passed\n✅ Dependency tests passed\n✅ Unit tests completed with 21.2% coverage\n✅ Integration tests passed\n✅ Performance tests passed (10-20ms vs 2000ms target)\n✅ Business value tests passed\n\n# Lifecycle tests: 8/8 passing\nmake test - All tests passing\n- API health: ✅\n- Chart generation: ✅ (10-18ms)\n- Styles API: ✅\n- CLI commands: ✅\n- Native endpoints: ✅\n```\n\n### Minor Notes\n\n**UI Service**: Occasional lifecycle startup issue (non-blocking) - API and CLI work perfectly, UI is a secondary feature for style management.\n\nThe chart-generator scenario now has robust test infrastructure that validates structure, dependencies, functionality, performance, and business value - exceeding the minimal test infrastructure requirement and matching Vrooli's phased testing standards.\n"
