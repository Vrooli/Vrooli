notes: '- **What it does:** Open-source parametric 3D CAD modeler with Python API for programmatic design generation. Supports architectural modeling, mechanical design, and engineering simulations with extensive file format compatibility. - **Use when:** Scenarios need automated CAD generation, parametric design workflows, or integration between design and manufacturing. Complements existing OpenSCAD for more complex engineering workflows. - **Technical requirements:** - Python 3.7+ with extensive scientific libraries - OpenGL for 3D rendering - Assembly workbench for multi-part designs - FEM workbench for finite element analysis - Path workbench for CAM/CNC integration'

    output: "[HEADER]  \U0001F916 Running Claude Code\n[INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n[WARNING] ⚠️  WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!\n[INFO]    Executing: timeout 1800 claude --print --max-turns 72 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions (prompt: 31711 chars)\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\nI've successfully generated the FreeCAD resource for Vrooli with the following accomplishments:\n\n1. **Created comprehensive PRD** - Defined the vision, requirements, and value proposition ($45K+) for FreeCAD as a parametric CAD resource\n2. **Implemented v2.0 contract compliance** - Full CLI structure following the universal contract with manage/test/content command groups\n3. **Core functionality working** - Health checks, lifecycle management (install/start/stop/restart), and status reporting all functional\n4. **Docker containerization** - Successfully pulls and runs the FreeCAD Docker image with Xvfb for headless operation\n5. **Port registry integration** - Added FreeCAD to port registry at port 8195\n6. **Test infrastructure** - Smoke tests passing (5/5 tests), with scaffolding for integration and unit tests\n\n### Current Status\n\n**Working**: The FreeCAD resource installs, starts, stops, and passes health checks successfully. The v2.0 CLI contract is fully implemented.\n\n**P0 Completion**: 60% (3/5 requirements completed)\n- ✅ Health Check\n- ✅ Lifecycle Management  \n- ✅ CLI Commands\n- ⬜ Python API (scaffolded but needs FreeCAD integration)\n- ⬜ STEP/IGES Export (scaffolded but needs implementation)\n\n### Evidence of Validation\n\n```bash\n# Successfully installed FreeCAD Docker image\n./cli.sh manage install  # Downloaded 1.5GB image successfully\n\n# Service starts and responds to health checks\n./cli.sh manage start --wait  # Started on port 8195\n./cli.sh status  # Shows RUNNING status with healthy state\n\n# All smoke tests pass\n./cli.sh test smoke  # 5/5 tests passed\n```\n\n### Remaining Limitations\n\n1. **FreeCAD Python API** - The container currently runs a simple HTTP server; needs proper FreeCAD service integration\n2. **CAD Operations** - Export, generation, and analysis functions are scaffolded but not yet functional\n3. **Integration Tests** - Need FreeCAD service running to test Python scripts and export functionality\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n\n1. Replace the simple HTTP server with a proper FreeCAD API service\n2. Implement the Python script execution pipeline for CAD generation\n3. Add STEP/IGES export functionality\n4. Enable FEM workbench for engineering analysis\n5. Add more comprehensive integration tests once FreeCAD service is fully operational\n\nThe resource provides a solid foundation that future improvers can build upon to add the remaining CAD functionality.\n"
