notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n1. Implemented core ERP modules for Customer Relationship Management (CRM), Accounting, and Human Resources (HR).\n   - CRM Module implemented: customer management, lead management, contact management, opportunity tracking\n   - Accounting Module implemented: invoice management, journal entries, chart of accounts, payment management, balance sheet reporting\n   - HR Module implemented: employee management, department management, leave applications, attendance tracking, salary structures\n2. Fixed error handling with meaningful feedback messages.\n3. Updated PRD accuracy to 57% with all P0 requirements now functional.\n\n**Current status:** \n- Status: Functional with core ERP capabilities working\n- P0 Requirements: 100% complete (7/7 features)\n- P1 Requirements: 25% complete (1/4 features)  \n- P2 Requirements: 0% complete (0/3 features)\n- Overall Completion: 57% (8/14 features)\n- Tests: All tests pass (100% success rate)\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** \n1. P1 requirements are not fully implemented (workflows and reporting modules).\n2. E-commerce and manufacturing modules are not properly implemented.\n3. Inventory and Project Management modules are missing.\n4. Multi-tenant support functionality needs improvement.\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n1. Fix workflow and reporting modules (P1 requirements)\n2. Properly implement e-commerce and manufacturing modules (P2)\n3. Add missing Inventory and Project Management modules\n4. Improve multi-tenant support functionality\n\n**Validation evidence:** \nThe resource now delivers real ERP functionality with working CRM, Accounting, and HR modules accessible via the CLI."
