notes: "May already be pretty good, but could probably benefit from some tidying. Notes from last time:\n### Current Status\n**Working/Improved** - All existing functionality preserved, P1 requirements advanced by 20%\n\n### Validation Evidence\n```bash\n# Health check: ✅ Passing\ntimeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:8095/health\n\n# Array data: ✅ Working\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8095/analyze -d '{\"data\": [{\"age\": 30}], \"query\": \"describe\"}'\n\n# Visualization: ✅ Working  \ncurl -X POST http://localhost:8095/analyze -d '{\"data\": [...], \"visualization\": true}'\n\n# Test suites: ✅ All passing\n./cli.sh test smoke    # ✅ Passed\n./cli.sh test integration  # ✅ Passed\n```\n\n### Improvements Made\n1. **Data Format Flexibility**: Now accepts both array and dictionary data formats\n2. **Visualization Generation**: New P1 feature for generating charts/graphs\n3. **Multiple Chart Types**: Supports bar, line, scatter, histogram, heatmap\n4. **Auto-Detection**: Intelligently selects best visualization type based on data"
