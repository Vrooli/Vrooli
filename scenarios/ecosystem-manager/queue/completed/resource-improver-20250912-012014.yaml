notes: "Notes from last time:\n### What Was Accomplished\nSuccessfully implemented the **Performance Tuning** P2 requirement for MinIO, adding comprehensive performance management capabilities:\n\n1. **Performance Profiles** - Configurable resource allocation modes:\n   - `minimal` - Low resource usage for development (2 cores, 64MB cache)\n   - `balanced` - Default general use (4 cores, 256MB cache)  \n   - `performance` - High performance production (8 cores, 1GB cache)\n   - `custom` - User-defined environment variables\n\n2. **Performance Monitoring** - Real-time metrics display:\n   - Container CPU and memory usage\n   - Network and block I/O statistics\n   - Active connection counts\n   - Server health information\n\n3. **Performance Benchmarking** - Built-in throughput testing:\n   - Configurable file size and iterations\n   - Upload/download speed measurements\n   - Performance rating (Excellent/Good/Needs Optimization)\n\n### Validation Evidence\n```bash\nvrooli resource minio test all  # All phases pass\nvrooli resource minio performance profile balanced  # Works correctly\nvrooli resource minio performance monitor  # Shows detailed metrics\nvrooli resource minio performance benchmark 100 5  # ~100MB/s throughput\n```\n\n### Key Improvements\n- **No Breaking Changes** - All existing functionality preserved\n- **Docker Integration** - Performance settings applied at container startup\n- **Cache Support** - Optional caching with dedicated volume mount\n- **Well Tested** - Integration tests validate all performance features\n- **Documented** - README updated with performance section and examples\n\n### Current Status\n- All P0 requirements complete (7/7) ✅\n- All P1 requirements complete (4/4) ✅\n- P2 requirements: 2/3 complete (versioning ✅, performance tuning ✅)\n- Only remaining P2 item is replication (requires significant architecture changes)\n\n### Net Progress\n- Added: 3 major features (profile management, monitoring, benchmarking)\n- Broken: 0 features\n- Net: +3 feature enhancements\n\nThe MinIO resource now provides enterprise-grade performance management capabilities, allowing users to optimize for their specific workloads while maintaining full S3 compatibility and data protection features."

The replication feature is fully implemented and working.\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\nSuccessfully implemented the **Replication** P2 requirement for MinIO, completing all remaining requirements:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Replication System** - Full multi-instance data replication:\n   - Created `lib/replication.sh` with complete replication management\n   - Supports both active-active (bi-directional) and active-passive (one-way) modes\n   - Automatic versioning enablement for replication requirements\n   - Manual sync capabilities with push/pull/both directions\n   - Real-time monitoring of replication lag and pending operations\n   - Failover management for disaster recovery scenarios\n\n2. **CLI Integration** - Added complete replication command group:\n   - `replication setup` - Configure replication to remote MinIO\n   - `replication status` - Show current replication state\n   - `replication enable/disable` - Control replication\n   - `replication sync` - Manual data synchronization\n   - `replication monitor` - Real-time metrics monitoring\n   - `replication failover` - Disaster recovery management\n   - `replication cleanup` - Remove replication configuration\n\n3. **Documentation & Testing**:\n   - Updated README with comprehensive replication guide\n   - Added integration tests for replication commands\n   - Updated PRD with completed P2 requirement\n   - All tests passing (smoke, integration, unit)\n\n### Current Status\n- **All P0 requirements complete** (7/7) ✅\n- **All P1 requirements complete** (4/4) ✅  \n- **All P2 requirements complete** (3/3) ✅\n  - Versioning ✅\n  - Performance Tuning ✅\n  - Replication ✅\n\n### Validation Evidence\n```bash\nvrooli resource minio test all  # All phases pass\nvrooli resource minio replication status  # Works correctly\n```\n\n### Net Progress\n- Added: Complete replication system with 8 commands\n- Broken: 0 features\n- Net: +1 major feature enhancement\n\nThe MinIO resource is now fully featured with all planned requirements complete, providing enterprise-grade object storage with S3 compatibility, data protection, performance optimization, and multi-instance replication capabilities.\n"
