notes: "Allegedly complete, but could benefit from additional validation/tidying.\n\nNotes from last time:\nSuccessfully implemented the **Replication** P2 requirement for MinIO, completing all remaining requirements:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Replication System** - Full multi-instance data replication:\n   - Created `lib/replication.sh` with complete replication management\n   - Supports both active-active (bi-directional) and active-passive (one-way) modes\n   - Automatic versioning enablement for replication requirements\n   - Manual sync capabilities with push/pull/both directions\n   - Real-time monitoring of replication lag and pending operations\n   - Failover management for disaster recovery scenarios\n\n2. **CLI Integration** - Added complete replication command group:\n   - `replication setup` - Configure replication to remote MinIO\n   - `replication status` - Show current replication state\n   - `replication enable/disable` - Control replication\n   - `replication sync` - Manual data synchronization\n   - `replication monitor` - Real-time metrics monitoring\n   - `replication failover` - Disaster recovery management\n   - `replication cleanup` - Remove replication configuration\n\n3. **Documentation & Testing**:\n   - Updated README with comprehensive replication guide\n   - Added integration tests for replication commands\n   - Updated PRD with completed P2 requirement\n   - All tests passing (smoke, integration, unit)\n\n### Current Status\n- **All P0 requirements complete** (7/7) ✅\n- **All P1 requirements complete** (4/4) ✅  \n- **All P2 requirements complete** (3/3) ✅\n  - Versioning ✅\n  - Performance Tuning ✅\n  - Replication ✅\n\n### Validation Evidence\n```bash\nvrooli resource minio test all  # All phases pass\nvrooli resource minio replication status  # Works correctly\n```\n\n### Net Progress\n- Added: Complete replication system with 8 commands\n- Broken: 0 features\n- Net: +1 major feature enhancement\n\nThe MinIO resource is now fully featured with all planned requirements complete, providing enterprise-grade object storage with S3 compatibility, data protection, performance optimization, and multi-instance replication capabilities."
