notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n- Successfully enhanced the privacy-terms-generator scenario to achieve 100% of P0 (must-have) requirements:\n  - Initialized database schema with proper tables for templates, documents, and business profiles\n  - Created and seeded 7 basic legal templates covering all major jurisdictions (US, EU, UK, CA, AU)\n  - Fixed database integration in generator.sh to use resource-postgres commands\n- Implemented days_old calculation for all templates\n- Added freshness status tracking (fresh/aging/stale based on 14/30 day thresholds) \n- Templates now show proper timestamps and age in list-templates command\n\n**Current status:**\n- All P0 requirements completed and functional.\n- The scenario now has:\n  - Full PostgreSQL integration for template storage\n  - Template freshness tracking with timestamps\n  - CLI that generates legal documents from database templates\n  - Support for all major jurisdictions\n  - Fallback generation for reliability\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- P1 features like web search integration to auto-update templates are not implemented yet.\n- PDF export using Browserless resource is not integrated.\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n- Implement P1 features (web search integration, etc.)\n- Add PDF export\n- Integrate Qdrant for semantic clause searching\n- Build out the UI for visual document generation\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Database schema created and populated with 7 templates\n- `make test` passes successfully\n- CLI generates valid privacy policies and terms of service\n- Template freshness tracking shows days_old for each template"

The scenario is working well. Let me create a final summary:\n\n## Summary\n\n**What was accomplished:**\nSuccessfully enhanced the privacy-terms-generator scenario with significant P1 feature implementations:\n\n1. **Web Search Integration** ✅\n   - Created `web_updater.sh` module to fetch legal requirements from authoritative sources\n   - Implemented template update mechanism with freshness tracking\n   - Added automatic template generation from web-sourced requirements\n\n2. **PDF Export Functionality** ✅\n   - Created `pdf_exporter.sh` module with HTML conversion and PDF generation\n   - Added multi-format support (Markdown, HTML, PDF) to CLI and API\n   - Integrated format selection into UI\n\n3. **Enhanced UI** ✅\n   - Connected UI to actual API endpoints\n   - Enabled all format options including PDF\n   - Fixed API integration for real document generation\n\n4. **Cookie & EULA Support** ✅\n   - Templates now support all document types (privacy, terms, cookie, EULA)\n   - CLI supports generation of all document types\n\n**Current status:** \n- P0 requirements: 100% complete\n- P1 requirements: 60% complete (3 out of 5 implemented)\n- All core functionality working and tested\n- Documentation updated with new features\n\n**Remaining P1 features not implemented:**\n- Version history tracking for generated documents\n- Semantic search for relevant clauses via Qdrant\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- CLI generates valid documents: `./cli/privacy-terms-generator generate privacy --business-name \"Test\" --jurisdiction US` ✅\n- Multiple formats supported: markdown, HTML, PDF ✅\n- Web update functionality implemented ✅\n- UI connected to real API ✅\n- Tests passing for core functionality ✅\n\n**Issues documented:**\n- Created PROBLEMS.md with Ollama command interface fix and other issues encountered\n- Updated PRD with progress tracking showing P1 60% completion\n- Enhanced README with new usage examples\n\nThe scenario now provides robust legal document generation with web-sourced template updates and multi-format export capabilities, significantly enhancing its value as a reusable Vrooli capability.\n"
