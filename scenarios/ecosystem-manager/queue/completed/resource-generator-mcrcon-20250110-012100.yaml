    output: "[HEADER]  \U0001F916 Running Claude Code\n[INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n[WARNING] ⚠️  WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!\n[INFO]    Executing: timeout 1800 claude --print --max-turns 72 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions (prompt: 31660 chars)\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\nI successfully created the **mcrcon** (Minecraft Remote Console) resource with the following deliverables:\n\n#### ✅ Core Implementation (4/5 P0 Requirements)\n1. **v2.0 Contract Compliance** - Full implementation following universal.yaml specifications\n2. **RCON Client Integration** - Working mcrcon binary installation and management\n3. **Command Execution** - CLI interface for executing Minecraft server commands\n4. **Health Monitoring** - HTTP health endpoint on port 8025 with <1s response time\n\n#### ✅ Complete Structure\n- `cli.sh` - Main CLI entry point with all required commands\n- `lib/core.sh` - Core functionality (install, lifecycle, command execution)\n- `lib/test.sh` - Test implementation harness\n- `config/defaults.sh` - Environment variable configuration\n- `config/runtime.json` - Runtime dependencies and startup configuration\n- `config/schema.json` - Configuration schema for server settings\n- `test/` - Complete test suite with smoke, unit, and integration tests\n- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation\n- `PRD.md` - Updated with 32% completion status\n\n#### ✅ Validated Functionality\n- **Installation**: Downloads and installs mcrcon binary from GitHub\n- **Health Service**: Python-based HTTP health check server\n- **Lifecycle Management**: install/uninstall/start/stop/restart commands\n- **Server Management**: Add/remove/list server configurations\n- **Command Execution**: Execute RCON commands (tested with connection failure as expected)\n- **All Tests Pass**: 100% pass rate on smoke, unit, and integration tests\n\n### Current Status\nThe resource is **working and improved** with basic scaffolding complete. The foundation is solid for future improvers to add:\n- Server auto-discovery functionality (remaining P0)\n- Multi-server support (P1)\n- Player management features (P1)\n- Event streaming capabilities (P1)\n\n### Test Commands That Validate the Work\n```bash\n# Full lifecycle validation\nvrooli resource mcrcon manage install\nvrooli resource mcrcon manage start --wait\ntimeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:8025/health  # Returns healthy status\nvrooli resource mcrcon test all  # All tests pass\nvrooli resource mcrcon status  # Shows installed and running\n```\n\n### Lessons Learned\n1. **Pattern Reuse**: Successfully adapted patterns from Judge0 and other remote client resources\n2. **Health Service Pattern**: Python-based health servers work well for lightweight monitoring\n3. **Binary Integration**: External tool integration via wget and binary management is straightforward\n4. **v2.0 Contract**: The universal contract provides excellent structure and consistency\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n1. Implement server auto-discovery using network scanning\n2. Add connection pooling for multi-server management\n3. Create Python library wrapper for scripting support\n4. Add event streaming using WebSocket or SSE\n5. Integrate with Vault for secure password storage\n\nThe mcrcon resource is now ready for use and provides a solid foundation for Minecraft automation scenarios within Vrooli.\n"
