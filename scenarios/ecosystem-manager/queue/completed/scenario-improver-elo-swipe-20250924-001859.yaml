notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Fixed CLI port configuration issue (was hardcoded to 19294, now reads from env)\n- Fixed integration test to properly set environment variables\n- All P0 requirements working and tested\n- UI functional with beautiful gradient design\n✅ **Fixed & Validated Core Functionality:**\n- Implemented CSV/JSON export functionality for rankings\n- Verified progress tracking already functional (shows X of Y comparisons)\n- Confidence scores already implemented and working\n- All integration tests passing (100% success rate)\n- API health checks working\n- CLI commands operational\n- UI screenshot captured showing working interface\n\n**Current status:**\nThe elo-swipe scenario is fully operational with enhanced export capabilities:\n- **API**: Running on dynamic port, all endpoints functional including new export\n- **UI**: Beautiful gradient interface, swipe functionality working  \n- **CLI**: Fixed and operational with all commands\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Elo calculations and confidence scores\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Undo/skip functionality during swiping (P1)\n- AI-assisted pre-filtering using ollama.json\n- Ranking visualization (graph/chart view)\n- Import lists from external sources\n- Collaborative ranking\n- Historical preference analytics\n### Remaining Features (P2 - Nice to Have)\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\nNone reported\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# Integration tests: 6/6 passing\n✓ API health check\n✓ List creation  \n✓ Getting comparisons\n✓ Submitting rankings\n✓ Retrieving rankings\n✓ CLI functionality\n\n# Export feature working:\ncurl \"http://localhost:19304/api/v1/lists/{id}/rankings?format=csv\"\n```"

Here's what was accomplished:\n\n### ✅ Key Improvements\n\n**1. Fixed UI Build Issue**\n- Resolved iframe-bridge import error (`/child` → root import)\n- UI now builds and runs without errors\n\n**2. Implemented Phased Testing Architecture**\n- Created comprehensive test suite:\n  - `test/phases/test-smoke.sh` (3 tests - all passing)\n  - `test/phases/test-unit.sh` (8 tests - all passing)  \n  - `test/phases/test-integration.sh` (6 tests - all passing)\n  - `test/run-tests.sh` (main test runner)\n- Added auto-port detection for reliable testing\n- Updated Makefile to use new phased testing\n\n**3. Added Go Unit Tests**\n- Created `api/smart_pairing_test.go` with 8 comprehensive test cases\n- Covers fallback pair generation and AI response parsing\n- All tests passing\n\n**4. Created Documentation**\n- **PROBLEMS.md**: Documents all issues (fixed and planned)\n- **Updated PRD.md**: Added 2025-10-03 progress entry\n- **Updated README.md**: Added testing section and current status\n\n### ✅ Verification Results\n\n**P0 Requirements: 6/6 ✓**\n- Swipe UI, Elo calculation, API, PostgreSQL, CLI, Multi-list support\n\n**P1 Requirements: 4/5 ✓**  \n- Smart pairing, Confidence scores, Export CSV/JSON, Progress tracking\n- ☐ Undo/skip (planned for next iteration)\n\n### Test Evidence\n\n```bash\n# All phased tests passing:\n✓ Smoke Tests: 3/3\n✓ Unit Tests: 8/8  \n✓ Integration Tests: 6/6\n```\n\nThe scenario is production-ready for its core functionality with robust testing infrastructure and complete documentation.\n"
