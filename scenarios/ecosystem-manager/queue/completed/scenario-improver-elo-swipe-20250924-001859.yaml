notes: |-
    Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    What was accomplished:
    - Fixed P0 Critical Issues:
      - CLI build errors - removed unused variables, builds cleanly
      - CLI installation - works globally with `elo-swipe` command
      - Health check endpoint - corrected path in service.json and tests
      - Port configuration - fixed hardcoded port issues
    - Implemented P1 Features:
      - Smart pairing algorithm - already implemented, verified functional
      - Confidence scores - calculation integrated in database updates
      - Multi-list support - verified working with isolated ranking pools

    Current status:
    - **API**: Running on port 19294, all endpoints functional
    - **UI**: Accessible at port 36107, swipe interface working
    - **CLI**: Installed and operational with all commands
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL schema with Elo calculations working
    - **Tests**: 100% integration tests passing

    Remaining issues or limitations:
    None reported

    Suggested next actions: None

    Validation evidence:
    ```bash
    # All integration tests passing:
    ✓ API health check
    ✓ List creation
    ✓ Getting comparisons
    ✓ Submitting rankings
    ✓ Retrieving rankings
    ✓ CLI functionality
    ```
