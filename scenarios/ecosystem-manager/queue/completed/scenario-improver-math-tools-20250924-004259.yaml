notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    What was accomplished:
    - Replaced generic template with actual math operations API
    - Implemented comprehensive endpoints for calculations, statistics, and matrices
    - API runs independently without requiring database connection
    - Health check and documentation endpoints working
    - Basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide, power, sqrt, log, exp) working
    - Statistical operations (mean, median, mode, stddev, variance) working
    - Matrix operations (multiply, transpose, determinant, inverse) working
    - Number theory (prime factors, GCD, LCM) working
    - RESTful API with authentication working
    - CLI with comprehensive commands working
    - Health monitoring endpoint working

    Current status:
    - Equation solving partially implemented
    - Optimization partially implemented
    - Forecasting partially implemented
    - Actual plotting/visualization not implemented
    - Advanced calculus operations not implemented
    - Database persistence not implemented

    Remaining issues or limitations:
    - API response times could be further optimized
    - There are some placeholder responses in optimization and forecasting sections

    Suggested next actions:
    - Implement equation solving completely
    - Complete optimization and forecasting sections
    - Add actual plotting/visualization functionality
    - Implement advanced calculus operations
    - Implement database persistence

    Validation evidence:
    ```bash
    # API Health: Returns proper Math Tools API status
    # Calculation: 10 + 20 + 30 = 60 ✓
    # Statistics: Mean of 1-10 = 5.5 ✓
    # Matrix Transpose: [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]] → [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]] ✓
    # CLI: All commands functional with proper output formatting ✓
    ```
