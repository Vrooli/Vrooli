    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed Test Infrastructure (Critical P0 Fix)
      - Corrected port configuration mismatch (tests were using old ports 3300/3301 instead of 17564/37181)
      - Fixed test script error handling that caused premature exit after first test
      - Result: Integration tests now run successfully with 14/16 tests passing (87% success rate)
    - Validated PRD Requirements
      - Confirmed 7/8 P0 requirements working (88% complete)
      - Verified image thumbnail generation is fully functional
      - Confirmed clipboard upload works (partial implementation)
      - All core functionality operational: file upload, auth, WebSocket infrastructure, UI
    - Updated Documentation
      - Updated PRD with accurate requirement status
      - Added implementation notes for today's improvements
      - Corrected completion metrics (was 6/8, now 7/8 P0s complete)

    **Current status:**
    - **Working**: API health, UI access, authentication, file upload, text upload, clipboard upload, thumbnails, deletion, CLI
    - **Partially Working**: Item listing, WebSocket connections (infrastructure ready, tests need fixing)
    - **Remaining P0**: Complete clipboard text sharing synchronization

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Incomplete implementation of clipboard synchronization
    - Failed test in WebSocket connection infrastructure

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Complete clipboard synchronization implementation (last P0)
    2. Fix WebSocket connection test (infrastructure working, test issue)
    3. Migrate to phased testing architecture for better maintainability

    **Validation evidence:**
    - API Health: `curl http://localhost:17564/health` returns healthy status
    - UI Access: `curl http://localhost:37181/` returns 200
    - Integration Tests: `make test` runs with 14/16 tests passing
    - Thumbnail Test: "Image upload with thumbnail successful" in test output
