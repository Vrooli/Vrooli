notes: '- **What it does:** Durable execution platform for building highly reliable distributed applications. Provides state management, automatic retries, and exactly-once execution guarantees for complex, long-running workflows. - **Use when:** Scenarios require mission-critical workflows, multi-step processes with guaranteed completion, or coordination between multiple services. Superior to n8n for workflows requiring strong consistency. - **Technical requirements:** - Temporal Server (self-hosted) - PostgreSQL or Cassandra for persistence - Elasticsearch for visibility (optional) - SDK support (Go, Java, TypeScript, Python, PHP) - Worker processes for workflow execution'

Test Docker implementation with `vrooli resource temporal manage install && vrooli resource temporal manage start`\n2. Implement SDK examples (Go, TypeScript, Python)\n3. Add workflow templates library\n4. Integrate with existing scenarios\n5. Add Elasticsearch for enhanced visibility\n6. Configure Prometheus metrics export\n\nThe Temporal resource is now ready as a foundation for building mission-critical workflows where failure is not an option, complementing n8n's visual automation and Windmill's scripting capabilities.\n"
