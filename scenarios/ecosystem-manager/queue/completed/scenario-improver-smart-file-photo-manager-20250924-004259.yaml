Focus on P0 requirements first - file upload and basic search\n2. Consider alternative to pgvector (use text search with pg_trgm)\n3. Test MinIO integration for file storage\n4. Initialize Qdrant collections using the JSON configuration\n5. Build simple UI test to verify gallery functionality\n\nThe scenario has progressed from **broken** to **partially working** with a clear path forward for completion.\n"
