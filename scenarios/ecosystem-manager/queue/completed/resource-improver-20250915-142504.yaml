    output: "[HEADER]  \U0001F916 Running Claude Code\n[INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n[WARNING] ⚠️  WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!\n[INFO]    Executing: timeout 3060 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions (prompt: 34071 chars)\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\n✅ **Fixed Port Detection Bug**: Replaced `lsof` with bash built-in `/dev/tcp` check that doesn't require sudo permissions. Unit tests now properly detect port conflicts.\n\n✅ **Fixed Docker Deprecation Warning**: Updated `docker stop --time` to `docker stop --timeout` to use the current Docker CLI syntax.\n\n✅ **Created PROBLEMS.md**: Added comprehensive troubleshooting guide documenting common issues, solutions, and performance tuning tips.\n\n✅ **Validated P0 Requirements**: All P0 requirements remain functional and tested:\n- v2.0 Contract compliance ✅\n- KRaft mode operation ✅  \n- Health checks ✅\n- Topic management ✅\n- Producer/Consumer support ✅\n- Persistent storage ✅\n- Connection pooling ✅\n\n### Current Status\n**Status**: Working/Improved\n- All P0 requirements (100%) are complete and functioning\n- Resource follows v2.0 universal contract\n- Lifecycle operations work correctly (install/start/stop/restart/uninstall)\n- All tests pass when run in correct context (unit tests with service stopped, integration/smoke with service running)\n- No regressions introduced\n\n### Validation Evidence\n```bash\n# Full lifecycle works\n./cli.sh manage install  # Success\n./cli.sh manage start --wait  # Starts in ~10s\n./cli.sh test smoke  # All pass\n./cli.sh manage stop  # Clean shutdown, no warnings\n\n# Tests pass appropriately  \n./cli.sh test unit  # All pass (when stopped)\n./cli.sh test integration  # All pass (when running)\n```\n\n### Lessons Learned\n- Port detection utilities like `lsof` require elevated permissions to see all processes\n- Bash's built-in `/dev/tcp` pseudo-device provides reliable port checking without sudo\n- Docker CLI flags evolve - staying current prevents deprecation warnings\n- Unit tests should validate configuration when service is not running\n\nThe Kafka resource is production-ready with all critical functionality working correctly.\n"
