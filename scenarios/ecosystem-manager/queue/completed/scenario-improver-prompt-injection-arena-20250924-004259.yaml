Test the scenario with actual Vrooli lifecycle when API is running\n2. Implement P2 features (real-time collaboration, advanced analytics)\n3. Add comprehensive integration tests for new features\n4. Create API documentation for new endpoints\n\nThe scenario now provides comprehensive prompt injection testing with vector search, tournament competitions, and research export capabilities - significantly enhancing Vrooli's security intelligence capabilities.\n"
