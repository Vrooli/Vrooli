The PostGIS resource is now functioning well with v2.0 compliance. Let me provide a final summary:\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\nSuccessfully improved the PostGIS resource from 0% to 64% completion:\n\n**P0 Requirements (86% Complete)**:\n- ✅ Basic lifecycle management (install, start, stop, restart, uninstall)\n- ✅ v2.0 contract compliance with proper test structure\n- ✅ Spatial database creation with PostGIS extensions\n- ✅ Secure connection management\n- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (smoke, unit, integration)\n- ✅ Proper port configuration\n- ⚠️ HTTP health endpoint not implemented (using pg_isready instead)\n\n**P1 Requirements (50% Complete)**:\n- ✅ Spatial data import (SQL files tested)\n- ✅ Query examples with practical templates\n- ❌ Performance optimization (partially done)\n- ❌ Cross-resource integration (not validated)\n\n### Current Status\n- **Working**: PostGIS 3.4 running successfully on port 5434\n- **Tests**: All test phases passing (smoke, unit, integration)\n- **v2.0 Compliance**: Structure fully compliant with universal.yaml\n- **Documentation**: PRD created, PROBLEMS.md added, README exists\n\n### Key Evidence\n- Container running: `postgis-main` \n- Version: PostGIS 3.4 with GEOS, PROJ, STATS\n- All tests passing with spatial functions verified\n- 10 spatial tables created including test data\n- Examples command shows practical spatial queries\n\n### Remaining Limitations\n- HTTP health endpoint not implemented (low priority - Docker health checks work)\n- Advanced GIS format import needs more work\n- Cross-resource integration not fully tested\n- P2 requirements (visualization, geocoding, advanced analysis) not started\n\nThe PostGIS resource is now production-ready for basic spatial database operations and can support location-based Vrooli scenarios.\n"
