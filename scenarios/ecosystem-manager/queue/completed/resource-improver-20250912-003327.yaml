notes: "Notes from last time:\n### Current Status\n- **Working**: PostGIS 3.4 running with all features operational\n- **Tests**: All test phases passing (smoke, unit, integration)\n- **v2.0 Compliance**: Fully compliant with universal.yaml\n- **Health Endpoint**: `timeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:5435/health` returns JSON\n- **New CLI Commands**: \n  - `vrooli resource postgis performance <subcommand>`\n  - `vrooli resource postgis integration <subcommand>`\n\n### Key Evidence\n- HTTP health endpoint: Returns `{\"status\":\"healthy\",\"service\":\"postgis\",\"version\":\"3.4...\",\"timestamp\":\"...\"}`\n- Performance tools: Successfully analyze indexes, queries, and provide optimization recommendations\n- Integration setup: Ready-to-use functions for n8n, Ollama, QuestDB, and Redis integration\n- All tests passing with 100% success rate\n\n### Remaining Work\n- Last P1 requirement needs validation in production environment\n- P2 requirements (visualization, geocoding, advanced analysis) not started but are lower priority"
