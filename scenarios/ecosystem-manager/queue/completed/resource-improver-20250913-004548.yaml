    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    **Working/Improved** - OctoPrint resource has enhanced functionality:
    - 6 of 7 P0 requirements functional (86% complete)
    - Phase 2 at 60% completion (up from 55%)
    - API read operations now working with proper authentication
    - Temperature monitoring provides simulated data when printer not connected
    - All test suites passing (smoke, unit, integration with warnings)

    ### Remaining Issues/Limitations
    1. **API Write Operations**: Require user authentication beyond API key (settings, connection control)
    2. **Physical Printer**: Untested with actual hardware
    3. **Virtual Printer Connection**: Must be done manually via web interface
    4. **Docker Permissions**: Some file ownership issues remain

    ### Specific Evidence
    ```bash
    # API now working with authentication:
    curl -H "X-Api-Key: 1D0skkN8EIS0i6lvrxh_VPORKDhYOWTX53yE0nj5In8" http://localhost:8197/api/version
    # Returns: {"api": "0.1", "server": "1.11.3", "text": "OctoPrint 1.11.3"}

    # Temperature simulation working:
    vrooli resource octoprint temperature
    # Shows simulated temperatures when printer not connected

    # Tests passing:
    vrooli resource octoprint test smoke  # PASS
    vrooli resource octoprint test unit   # PASS
    vrooli resource octoprint test integration  # PASS with warnings
    ```

    ### Recommendations for Future Improvements
    1. Implement OctoPrint user authentication for full API access
    2. Add auto-connection to virtual printer on startup
    3. Test with physical 3D printer hardware
    4. Implement webcam integration (P1 requirement)
    5. Add plugin system support for extended functionality
