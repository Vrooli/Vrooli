notes: "Pretty good already, but could likely benefit from additional validation/tidying.\n\nNotes from last time:\nThe Nextcloud resource has been successfully validated and tidied. All functionality is working perfectly.\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\n✅ **Validation Complete**\n- All tests passing (smoke, unit, integration) \n- All P0 requirements (7/7) fully functional\n- All P1 requirements (4/4) fully functional  \n- P2 requirements: 2/3 complete (Talk & CalDAV/CardDAV working)\n- v2.0 contract fully compliant\n\n✅ **Tidying Complete**\n- Removed old backup file (freed 271MB disk space)\n- Verified code structure follows best practices\n- Confirmed error handling and timeout usage correct\n- Documentation accurate and comprehensive\n\n✅ **Performance & Security Verified**\n- APCu local memory caching active\n- Redis distributed caching configured\n- Security headers and brute force protection enabled\n- All containers healthy and running\n\n### Current State\n- **Collabora Office**: ✅ Working (document editing)\n- **Talk**: ✅ Working (video conferencing)  \n- **CalDAV/CardDAV**: ✅ Working (calendar/contacts)\n- **External Storage**: ✅ S3 mounting available\n- **Security**: ✅ Hardened configuration applied\n\n### Test Results\n```bash\nvrooli resource nextcloud test all\n# ✅ Smoke tests: All pass\n# ✅ Unit tests: All pass  \n# ✅ Integration tests: All pass (including Collabora and Talk)\n```\n\n### Remaining Limitation\n- Mobile push notifications require external service configuration (P2 requirement)\n\nThe Nextcloud resource is in excellent condition with all critical functionality operational and optimized."
