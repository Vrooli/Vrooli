Test document processing with real PDF/DOCX files\n2. Validate content management commands (add/list/get/remove)\n3. Test caching system functionality\n4. Create integration examples with Ollama and n8n\n5. Fix unit test sourcing issues (low priority)\n\nThe resource is now v2.0 compliant and ready for further improvements focused on validating its document processing capabilities.\n"
