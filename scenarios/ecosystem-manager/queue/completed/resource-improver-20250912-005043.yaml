notes: "Notes from last time:\n### What Was Accomplished\n\nThe unstructured-io resource has been successfully improved with the following enhancements:\n\n1. **Security Compliance** ✅\n   - Removed all hardcoded port fallback values (security violation)\n   - Now properly uses environment variables from port registry\n   - Fixed in: lib/common.sh, lib/test-api.sh, test/integration-test.sh\n\n2. **v2.0 Contract Compliance** ✅\n   - Added missing config/schema.json file\n   - Full compliance with universal.yaml specification\n   - All required CLI commands and file structure in place\n\n3. **Validation and Testing** ✅\n   - All tests pass: smoke, unit, and integration\n   - Health checks working properly with timeout\n   - Document processing functionality confirmed working\n   - Resource memory usage: ~70MB / 4GB limit\n   - CPU usage: <0.1% when idle\n\n### Current Status\n- **Working**: Resource is fully functional and production-ready\n- **PRD Progress**: 100% complete (all P0, P1, P2 requirements met)\n- **v2.0 Compliant**: Yes\n- **Security Compliant**: Yes\n- **Tests Passing**: All phases pass\n\n### Evidence\n```bash\n# All tests pass\nvrooli resource unstructured-io test all  # ✅ Passed\n\n# Health check works\ntimeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:11450/healthcheck  # ✅ Returns healthy\n\n# Document processing works\nvrooli resource unstructured-io content process /tmp/test.txt hi_res text  # ✅ Success\n```\n\n### Remaining Limitations\nMinor known issues that don't affect core functionality:\n- OPTIONS request to processing endpoint returns warning (expected behavior)\n- Metadata extraction shows minimal data for simple text files (by design)\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n1. Create comprehensive OCR test suite with various image formats\n2. Performance testing with larger documents (100+ pages)  \n3. Add support for additional output formats (Markdown, XML)\n4. Optimize concurrent request handling\n\nThe unstructured-io resource is now fully compliant with security requirements and v2.0 standards while maintaining 100% functionality."
