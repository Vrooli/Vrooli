Here's what I discovered:\n\n### \U0001F3AF Core Architecture\n\n**Three-Layer System:**\n1. **Scenarios** - Dual-purpose templates that serve as both integration tests AND $10K-50K revenue-generating business applications\n2. **Resources** - 30+ local services (databases, AI models, automation tools) that agents orchestrate to build complete applications  \n3. **Recursive Intelligence** - Every solution becomes a permanent capability that improves future problem-solving\n\n### \U0001F680 Key Components\n\n**Resources** (in `/resources/`):\n- **AI**: Ollama, Claude Code, Whisper, Gemini\n- **Storage**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, MinIO, Vault\n- **Automation**: n8n, Windmill, Node-RED, Agent-S2\n- **Execution**: Judge0, Browserless, ComfyUI\n\n**Scenarios** (in `/scenarios/`) - 130+ business applications including:\n- Research Assistant\n- Document Processing Pipeline\n- Content Creation Studio  \n- App Monitor\n- Ecosystem Manager (meta-scenario that improves Vrooli itself)\n\n### \U0001F4A1 Revolutionary Concept\n\nVrooli isn't just automation - it's **artificial evolution**. The system:\n- Generates complete applications (UI + API + database + CLI) from requirements\n- Preserves your customizations through intelligent modification detection\n- Compounds intelligence - every solved problem makes future problems easier\n- Creates business value directly - each scenario can generate $10K-50K revenue\n\n### \U0001F527 Technical Implementation\n\n- **Local-first**: Everything runs on your hardware for complete privacy\n- **Language-agnostic**: Go, Node.js, Python components work together\n- **Service.json lifecycle**: v2.0 declarative configuration for scenario management\n- **CLI-driven**: `vrooli` command for all operations\n\nThe vision: Every household and business running their own Vrooli server, generating custom software instantly without cloud dependencies.\n"
