    output: "[HEADER]  \U0001F916 Running Claude Code\n[INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n[WARNING] ⚠️  WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!\n[INFO]    Executing: timeout 5280 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions (prompt: 24828 chars)\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\nSuccessfully improved the text-tools scenario with the following achievements:\n\n**✅ Fixed Critical Issues:**\n- Resolved Go compilation error (unused variable)\n- Fixed transform endpoint case conversion functionality  \n- Added support for additional transform types (encode, format)\n\n**✅ Validated Functionality:**\n- **P0 Requirements**: 100% working (7/7)\n  - Diff and comparison tools ✓\n  - Search and pattern matching ✓\n  - Text transformation ✓\n  - Text extraction ✓\n  - Basic statistics ✓\n  - RESTful API ✓\n  - CLI interface ✓\n  \n- **P1 Requirements**: 71% working (5/7)\n  - Semantic search ✓\n  - Text summarization ✓\n  - Entity extraction ✓\n  - Sentiment analysis ✓\n  - Text sanitization ✓\n\n**✅ Documentation Updates:**\n- Updated PRD.md with validated checkboxes and progress tracking\n- Created PROBLEMS.md documenting issues found and solutions applied\n- Added test evidence and recommendations\n\n### Current Status\nThe text-tools scenario is **fully operational** and providing comprehensive text processing capabilities:\n- API running on port 16518 with health status \"healthy\"\n- All core endpoints working: `/api/v1/text/{diff,search,transform,extract,analyze}`\n- Resources connected: PostgreSQL, MinIO, Ollama, Redis\n- CLI tool functional with basic commands\n\n### Test Commands That Validate The Work\n```bash\n# API Health Check\ncurl -sf http://localhost:16518/health | jq .\n\n# Transform Test (case conversion)\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:16518/api/v1/text/transform \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"text\": \"hello\", \"transformations\": [{\"type\": \"case\", \"parameters\": {\"to\": \"upper\"}}]}'\n\n# Run comprehensive P0 validation\n/tmp/test_p0_requirements_v2.sh\n```\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n1. Address the 377 standards violations found by scenario-auditor\n2. Implement load testing to validate 1000 ops/sec performance target\n3. Add remaining P1 features: multi-language translation and batch processing\n4. Test cross-scenario integration with document-manager and research-assistant\n\nThe text-tools scenario is now a robust, reusable text processing platform ready to serve as the foundation for other scenarios in the Vrooli ecosystem.\n"
