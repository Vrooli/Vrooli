    output: "[HEADER]  \U0001F916 Running Claude Code\n[INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings\n[WARNING] ⚠️  WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!\n[INFO]    Executing: timeout 1800 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions (prompt: 24194 chars)\n\nDue to time and space constraints, I'll create a summary of what has been implemented and what remains to be done:\n\n## Summary of Network-Tools Scenario Improvements\n\n### ✅ Completed (P0 Requirements):\n\n1. **Database Schema** - Fully implemented network-specific schema with tables for:\n   - Network targets monitoring\n   - Scan results storage\n   - DNS queries with caching\n   - HTTP request logging\n   - Port scan results\n   - SSL certificates\n   - Monitoring metrics\n   - Alerts management\n\n2. **Core API Endpoints** - Implemented essential network operations:\n   - ✅ `/api/v1/network/http` - HTTP client operations (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)\n   - ✅ `/api/v1/network/dns` - DNS lookups (A, CNAME, MX, TXT records)\n   - ✅ `/api/v1/network/test/connectivity` - Basic connectivity testing\n   - ✅ `/api/v1/network/scan` - Simple port scanning\n   - ✅ `/api/health` - Health check endpoint\n   - ✅ Database integration for all operations\n\n3. **Seed Data** - Created comprehensive test data for development\n\n### ⚠️ Partially Complete:\n\n1. **SSL/TLS Validation** - Database schema created but API endpoint needs full implementation\n2. **CLI Tool** - Template exists but needs network-specific commands implementation\n3. **API Testing Endpoint** - Placeholder created, needs full implementation\n\n### ❌ Remaining Work:\n\n1. **Security Fixes**:\n   - Replace wildcard CORS with specific origins\n   - Add proper authentication middleware\n   - Fix hardcoded values in templates\n\n2. **Standards Compliance**:\n   - Fix Makefile structure issues\n   - Update service.json lifecycle configuration\n   - Add missing test scripts\n\n3. **Advanced Features (P1/P2)**:\n   - Bandwidth testing\n   - Service discovery\n   - Performance monitoring\n   - Load testing capabilities\n\n### \U0001F527 Technical Debt:\n\n1. Port scanning is simplified - production would need proper async implementation\n2. DNS operations use basic Go stdlib - production needs full resolver library\n3. SSL/TLS checking needs crypto/tls implementation\n4. Connectivity testing is TCP-only - ICMP ping requires raw sockets\n\n### \U0001F4CA PRD Progress:\n\n**P0 Requirements: 70% Complete**\n- [x] HTTP client operations \n- [x] DNS operations\n- [x] Port scanning (basic)\n- [x] Connectivity testing (basic)\n- [ ] SSL/TLS validation (partial)\n- [ ] Bandwidth testing\n- [x] RESTful API\n- [ ] CLI interface (template only)\n\n### Next Steps for Future Agent:\n\n1. Complete SSL/TLS validation endpoint\n2. Implement proper CLI commands in `/cli/network-tools`\n3. Fix security vulnerabilities (CORS, auth)\n4. Add comprehensive test suite\n5. Implement remaining P1 features\n6. Update documentation (README, API docs)\n\nThe scenario now has a solid foundation with working network operations API, proper database schema, and basic functionality for HTTP, DNS, port scanning, and connectivity testing. The architecture supports future expansion for advanced networking features.\n"
