notes: "Notes from last time:\n### Current Status\n- **Working**: Smoke tests pass (12/12 tests passing)\n- **All P0 Requirements**: 100% complete (7/7)\n- **All P1 Requirements**: 100% complete (5/5)\n- **P2 Requirements**: Not yet implemented (3 items remaining for future work)\n\n### Evidence of Work\n```bash\n# Smoke test validation:\n./test/phases/test-smoke.sh\n# Result: 12 tests passed, 0 failed\n\n# CLI commands work:\nresource-openrouter help      # ✓ Shows comprehensive help\nresource-openrouter status    # ✓ Shows resource status\nresource-openrouter info      # ✓ Shows runtime configuration\n```\n\n### Remaining Limitations\n- Integration and unit tests still have sourcing issues (non-critical)\n- P2 requirements not implemented:\n  - Model performance benchmarking\n  - Custom routing rules  \n  - Cloudflare AI Gateway integration\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n1. Fix the sourcing issue in credentials-utils.sh to eliminate test failures\n2. Implement P2 requirements for enhanced functionality\n3. Add real API key testing capabilities\n4. Consider adding more comprehensive integration tests"

Implement P2 requirements for enhanced functionality\n2. Add real API key testing capabilities in a secure environment\n3. Consider adding model-specific performance metrics\n4. Implement caching for frequently used models to reduce API calls\n"
