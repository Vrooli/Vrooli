notes: "Notes from last time:\n### What Was Accomplished\n- **Fixed Test Suite Issues**: Resolved arithmetic operation failures in test scripts caused by `set -e` incompatibility with `((var++))` when var=0\n- **All Tests Now Passing**: \n  - Smoke tests: 12/12 passing\n  - Integration tests: 10/10 passing  \n  - Unit tests: 16/16 passing\n- **Verified P0 Requirements**: All 7 P0 requirements confirmed working\n- **Verified P1 Requirements**: All 5 P1 requirements confirmed working\n- **Updated Documentation**: PRD updated with accurate progress and fixes\n\n### Current Status\n- **Working**: All test suites pass completely\n- **P0 Requirements**: 100% complete and verified\n- **P1 Requirements**: 100% complete and verified\n- **P2 Requirements**: Not implemented (future work)\n\n### Evidence of Work\n```bash\n# All tests passing:\nresource-openrouter test all\n# Result: smoke (12/12), integration (10/10), unit (16/16)\n\n# CLI commands functional:\nresource-openrouter help      # ✓ Comprehensive help\nresource-openrouter status    # ✓ Shows status\nresource-openrouter info      # ✓ Runtime configuration\nresource-openrouter content models  # ✓ Lists available models\n```\n\n### Remaining Limitations\n- Requires real API key for actual model execution (uses placeholder for testing)\n- P2 requirements not implemented (model benchmarking, custom routing, Cloudflare integration)"
