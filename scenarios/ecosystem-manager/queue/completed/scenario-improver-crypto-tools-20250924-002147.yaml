    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    What was accomplished:
    - Fixed API Port Configuration by updating main.go to use API_PORT environment variable instead of hardcoded PORT
    - Built Crypto-Specific Functionality including hash operations (SHA-256, SHA-512, bcrypt, scrypt), encryption (AES-256 CFB mode with automatic key generation), decryption, key generation (RSA and symmetric), and key management (list and retrieve keys endpoints implemented)
    - Database Schema Ready: comprehensive crypto-schema.sql with tables for operations, keys, certificates, security events

    Current status:
    - 6 out of 8 P0 Requirements Complete
    - Hashing operations, Symmetric encryption, Asymmetric encryption, Key generation, Base64/hex encoding, RESTful API all complete
    - Digital signatures partially implemented (endpoints exist but not implemented)
    - CLI interface not implemented

    Remaining issues or limitations:
    - Fix CORS Security (high severity issue) and remove wildcard configuration
    - Complete Digital Signatures by implementing sign/verify handlers
    - Implement CLI for API
    - Database Integration: configure proper PostgreSQL connection
    - Add More Algorithms: ChaCha20, Ed25519, ECDSA support

    Suggested next actions:
    1. **P0: Implement CLI** - Create crypto-tools CLI wrapper for API
    2. **P0: Complete Digital Signatures** - Implement sign/verify handlers
    3. **P1: Fix CORS Security** - Replace wildcard with specific origins
    4. **P1: Database Integration** - Configure proper PostgreSQL connection
    5. **P2: Add More Algorithms** - ChaCha20, Ed25519, ECDSA support

    Validation evidence:
    - Functional Tests passed (Health check endpoint returns crypto_stats, Hash endpoint produces correct SHA-256 output, Encryption endpoint encrypts data with AES-256)
    - Security Audit showed 1 High severity issue (CORS wildcard configuration) and 238 standards violations (mostly formatting and env validation warnings)

Implement real cryptographic signing with Go crypto/rsa and crypto/ecdsa packages\n2. Add fixed port configuration in service.json\n3. Implement additional algorithms (ChaCha20, Ed25519, ECDSA)\n4. Add certificate management (X.509 creation/validation)\n"
