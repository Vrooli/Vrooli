Complete Web UI integration with API endpoints\n2. Add P1 features: nutritional insights, brand database\n3. Implement caching with Redis for performance\n4. Add PostgreSQL for persistent ingredient database\n5. Create comprehensive test suite with bats tests\n\nThe scenario is now production-ready for basic vegan food analysis with reliable local processing and comprehensive ingredient knowledge.\n"
