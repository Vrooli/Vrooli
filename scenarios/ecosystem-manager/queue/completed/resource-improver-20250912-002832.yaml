notes: Notes from last time indicate that kicad is being mocked, due to it being an uninstalled desktop app. If possible, the kicad resource should install the desktop application in `resource-kicad manage install`, or at minimum clearly explain how to install it. Also, not sure if you saw this but it is possible to use kicad programmatically. See https://jeffmcbride.net/kicad-component-layout
