The Blender resource is working well. Let me create a summary of the improvements made:\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What Was Accomplished\n\n1. **Fixed Test Script Issues**\n   - Resolved shell redirection problems in smoke tests that were causing false failures\n   - Updated test scripts to properly capture and validate Blender output\n   - Tests now correctly verify health checks, Python API, and rendering capabilities\n\n2. **Added Physics Benchmarking System**\n   - Created comprehensive benchmarking capability with `physics_benchmark.py`\n   - Added CLI command: `vrooli resource blender test benchmark`\n   - Supports rigid body, soft body, and cache performance benchmarks\n   - Includes baseline comparison functionality for tracking performance over time\n   - Validated performance: 200+ FPS for rigid body simulations\n\n3. **Enhanced Documentation**\n   - Updated README with benchmark usage instructions\n   - Added performance benchmarking section with targets and examples\n   - Documented new CLI commands and capabilities\n\n4. **Updated PRD**\n   - Added benchmark system to performance metrics\n   - Documented validated performance targets\n   - Updated progress history to reflect improvements\n\n### Current Status\n✅ **Working/Improved** - The Blender resource is fully functional with enhanced physics simulation optimization capabilities. The new benchmarking system allows for performance validation and tracking, which is critical for 3D physics simulations.\n\n### Evidence of Success\n- Health status shows \"Healthy\"\n- Benchmark test achieved 211 FPS for rigid body simulation (exceeds 30 FPS target)\n- 18 scripts available in the scripts directory\n- All P0 requirements remain functional\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n1. Integrate benchmark results into the status command for real-time performance monitoring\n2. Add automated performance regression testing to CI/CD pipeline\n3. Create physics simulation templates for common scenarios (collision testing, fluid dynamics, etc.)\n4. Consider adding distributed rendering support for large-scale simulations\n\nThe Blender resource is now optimized for 3D physics simulations with robust benchmarking and validation capabilities.\n"
