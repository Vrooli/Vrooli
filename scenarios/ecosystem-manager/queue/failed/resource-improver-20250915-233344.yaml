notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n- Successfully improved the farmOS resource to 100% P0 completion:\n  - OAuth2/Authentication Implementation: Created comprehensive API library (`lib/api.sh`) with Basic Authentication support for farmOS API access\n  - API CRUD Operations: Implemented full CRUD operations for Fields, Assets (equipment, livestock, etc.), Logs (activities, observations, harvests), and Export functionality (JSON/CSV)\n  - Automatic Installation: Created `lib/install.sh` to auto-complete farmOS setup using drush, including demo data seeding\n  - Health Monitoring: Fixed health checks to properly validate service status (farmOS doesn't have `/health` endpoint)\n  - CLI Integration: Connected all API functions to CLI commands for farm management operations\n\n**Current status:** \n- Working: Full P0 functionality implemented and tested\n- Health Checks: Smoke tests pass successfully\n- API Authentication: Basic Auth working for protected endpoints\n- Demo Data: Auto-seeded with fields, equipment, livestock, and activity logs\n- CLI Commands: All farm management commands functional\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** \n- Initial installation takes 2-3 minutes on first startup\n- Some API endpoints require authentication even for public data\n- P1 requirements (IoT, QuestDB integration) not yet implemented\n- P2 requirements (multi-farm support) pending\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n- Address initial installation time delay\n- Resolve issue with API endpoint authentication\n- Implement P1 requirements (IoT, QuestDB integration)\n- Progress on P2 requirements (multi-farm support)\n\n**Validation evidence:** \n```bash\n# Smoke tests pass\nvrooli resource farmos test smoke  # All tests PASS\n\n# Authentication works\nvrooli resource farmos content execute authenticate  # Success\n\n# Service healthy\nvrooli resource farmos status  # Shows running and healthy\n```"
