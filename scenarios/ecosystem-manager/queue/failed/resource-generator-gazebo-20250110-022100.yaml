notes: '- **What it does:** Modern open-source robotics simulator (formerly Ignition) supporting multiple physics engines, sensor simulation, and robot modeling. Provides high-fidelity 3D environments for testing autonomous systems, robot behaviors, and control algorithms before real-world deployment. - **Use when:** Scenarios need robotics simulation, autonomous vehicle testing, drone flight simulation, or multi-robot coordination. Essential for validating robot behaviors, testing sensor configurations, and training reinforcement learning agents in safe virtual environments. - **Technical requirements:** - DART physics engine (default) or Bullet/custom engines - Python API with 256K token context support - ROS 2 integration for robot middleware - OpenGL/OGRE for realistic rendering - TCP/IP transport for distributed simulation'
