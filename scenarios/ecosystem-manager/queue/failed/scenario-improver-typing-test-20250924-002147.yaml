notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n- Fixed critical build issues - Resolved missing Go dependencies and unused imports \n- Verified all P0 requirements - Core typing test, WPM calculation, accuracy tracking, health check, and lifecycle management all working \n- Validated P1 features - Database integration, leaderboard, difficulty levels all functional \n- Updated documentation - Created proper PRD with checkboxes, added PROBLEMS.md \n- Tested scenario thoroughly - API endpoints, UI, CLI, and database all confirmed working \n\n**Current status:** \nWorking: The typing-test scenario is fully functional with:\n- Retro arcade-themed UI running on port 35165 \n- Go API with health checks on port 16610 \n- PostgreSQL integration for progress tracking \n- CLI tool for command-line typing tests \n- Multiple difficulty levels and leaderboard \n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** \n- Ollama AI coaching not fully integrated (basic coaching works) \n- Export features (CSV/PDF) not yet implemented \n- Custom text upload feature not available \n\n**Suggested next actions:** \nNone reported \n\n**Validation evidence:** \n- Health check: `{\"status\":\"healthy\"}` \n- UI screenshot: Captured retro typing interface \n- API endpoints: `/api/submit-score`, `/api/leaderboard`, `/api/coaching` all tested \n- Database: Successfully storing and retrieving scores \n- CLI: `typing-test --help` shows full functionality"
