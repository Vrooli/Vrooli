notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\nWhat was accomplished:\n1. Fixed HTTP Server Issue: Resolved the previous Go HTTP server hanging problem - the API now starts and responds correctly on dynamically assigned ports\n2. Validated All P0 Requirements: \n   - ✅ Discovery of maintenance scenarios (10 found)\n   - ✅ API endpoints for activate/deactivate working\n   - ✅ All scenarios start inactive by default\n   - ✅ Status endpoint functional\n   - ✅ UI dashboard accessible and working\n   - ✅ 7 default presets available (exceeds requirement of 3)\n3. UI Dashboard Fully Functional: Dashboard connects to API, shows all scenarios with toggle switches, displays presets, and updates in real-time\n4. CLI Commands Working: All CLI commands (status, list, activate, deactivate, preset) tested and functional\n5. Documentation Updated: Updated PROBLEMS.md with current issues and README.md with accurate instructions\n\nCurrent status:\n- **Working**: Full scenario functionality - API, UI, and CLI all operational\n- **Improved**: Better than initial state with all P0 requirements validated\n\nRemaining issues or limitations:\n- 520 standards violations and 2 security issues reported by auditor (non-critical)\n- Dynamic port assignment can be confusing but works as designed\n- Auditor output too large for processing (jq argument list error)\n\nSuggested next actions: None reported\n\nValidation evidence:\n- Health check responds in <100ms\n- 10 maintenance scenarios discovered and manageable\n- UI dashboard screenshot shows connected status and all scenarios\n- CLI commands produce expected output\n- Test suite passes all checks\n- Preset application successfully activates/deactivates scenarios"
