    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Started health monitor for claude-code with PID: 2314169 and interval: 30s.
    - Executed `claude` command with parameters: `--print`, `--max-turns 80`, `--allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep`, and `--dangerously-skip-permissions`.

    **Current status:**
    - Running in non-TTY environment using automation-friendly settings.
    - Permission checks are disabled.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Agent processes are not running for claude-code-agent-1758958427, ecosystem-scenario-improver-algorithm-library, claude-code-agent-1758958577, and ecosystem-scenario-improver-api-library.
    - Reached max turns (80) error encountered during execution.

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Start the agent processes for claude-code-agent-1758958427, ecosystem-scenario-improver-algorithm-library, claude-code-agent-1758958577, and ecosystem-scenario-improver-api-library.
    2. Investigate and address permission check issues or re-enable them.

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Error message: "Reached max turns (80)".
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
