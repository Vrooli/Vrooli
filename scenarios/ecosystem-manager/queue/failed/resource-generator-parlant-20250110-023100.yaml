notes: '- **What it does:** Python SDK for controlled multi-agent development emphasizing reliability over hope-based compliance. Features behavioral guidelines with contextual matching, journey definitions, natural language control, and production-ready tool integration for predictable agent behavior. - **Use when:** Scenarios need reliable LLM agents, customer service automation, controlled conversational AI, or enterprise chatbots. Essential for production deployments requiring consistent, predictable agent behavior rather than experimental systems. - **Technical requirements:** - Python SDK with decorator-based tools - Natural language behavioral guidelines - Context variable management - Journey and state definitions - Enterprise-grade reliability focus'
