notes: '- **What it does:** Cross-platform AI engine providing pre-built computer vision models via REST API. Includes object detection (80+ classes), face detection/recognition, scene recognition, and custom model training. - **Use when:** Scenarios need computer vision without ML expertise - security monitoring, content moderation, automated tagging, accessibility features, or visual automation workflows. - **Technical requirements:** - Docker deployment with CPU or GPU acceleration - REST API on configurable port - Redis for caching recognition results - Custom model support via training API - Integration with webcam feeds and image uploads'
