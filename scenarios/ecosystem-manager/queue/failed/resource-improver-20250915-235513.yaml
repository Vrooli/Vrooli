    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Created proper Docker Compose configuration with OpenEMR 7.0.2 and MySQL 8.0
    - Configured health checks and container dependencies
    - Set up proper networking with openemr-network
    - Added OpenEMR ports to the central registry (8010-8012)
    - Updated configuration to use registered ports
    - Avoided conflicts with existing services
    - Fixed SCRIPT_DIR path issues in cli.sh, core.sh, and test.sh
    - Implemented full lifecycle commands (install, start, stop, restart, uninstall)
    - Added health check validation with proper timeouts
    - Created content management framework (add, list, get, remove, export)

    **Current status:**
    - CLI commands execute properly
    - Health checks validate service status
    - Docker Compose configuration is valid
    - Port allocation prevents conflicts
    - Documentation is comprehensive

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Authentication (OAuth2 pending)
    - Appointment Scheduling (API integration needed)
    - FHIR Export (configuration required)

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Complete OAuth2 token retrieval structure
    - Finish API integration for appointment scheduling and FHIR export
    - Validate CLI functionality with additional tests

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Smoke tests for quick validation
    - Integration tests for functionality
    - Unit tests for library functions
    - All test phases properly structured
