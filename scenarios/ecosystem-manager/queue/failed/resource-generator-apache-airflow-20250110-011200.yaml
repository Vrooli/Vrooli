notes: '- **What it does:** Python-based platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring data workflows as DAGs. Version 3.0 brings DAG versioning, enhanced backfills, and client-server architecture. - **Use when:** Building complex ETL/ELT pipelines, orchestrating data workflows across multiple systems, scheduling batch processing jobs, or managing dependencies between data tasks. - **Technical requirements:** - Python 3.8+ runtime environment - PostgreSQL for metadata storage - Redis/RabbitMQ for executor communication - Docker/Kubernetes for task isolation - Webserver and scheduler components'
