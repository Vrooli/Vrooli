    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Successfully started health monitor for claude-code with PID: 1086897 and interval: 30s
    - Executed command: timeout 5280 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions

    **Current status:**
    - Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings
    - Permission checks are disabled (WARNING)
    - Reached max turns (80) with error message "Reached max turns (80)"

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Agent claude-code-agent-1759210086-1086866 (PID: 1086866) is not running
    - Agent ecosystem-scenario-improver-workflow-scheduler-20250924-002147 (PID: 1086866) is not running

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Investigate and resolve issues with running agents claude-code-agent-1759210086-1086866 and ecosystem-scenario-improver-workflow-scheduler-20250924-002147
    - Review and adjust max turns setting to avoid premature termination of the command

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Health monitor is active with PID: 1086897 and interval: 30s
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (60). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
