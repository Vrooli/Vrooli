notes: Focus on optimizing AI-powered code generation capabilities. High priority due to central role in AI-assisted development workflows. May need secrets config (see resources/vault.docs/SECRETS_STANDARD.md) so we can set up api keys or whatever is needed. Among other general fixes/improvements
results:
    error: Claude reached maximum turns limit. Consider breaking the task into smaller parts or increasing MAX_TURNS.
