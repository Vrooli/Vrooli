notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed critical bug in metrics command where jq was hanging due to incorrect input syntax
    - Changed jq command from using `input` (which waits for stdin) to proper `--argjson` parameter
    - Verified all existing functionality remains intact - no regressions
    - Updated PRD documentation with fix details

    **Current status:**
    - **Working**: All functionality is operational
    - **Improved**: Fixed metrics command hanging issue with jq
    - **Tests**: All test suites passing (smoke, integration, unit)
    - **PRD**: 100% complete - All P0 (7/7), P1 (4/4), and P2 (3/3) requirements fulfilled

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    None reported

    **Suggested next actions:**
    None

    **Validation evidence:**
    ```bash
    # Full test suite passes
    vrooli resource esphome test all  # ✓ All 15 tests pass

    # Health check working
    vrooli resource esphome status    # ✓ Shows healthy status

    # Metrics command fixed (was hanging, now works)
    vrooli resource esphome metrics   # ✓ Now properly executes
    ```
