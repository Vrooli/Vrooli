notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n1. Fixed Database Schema - Added missing tables (safety_rules, active_contexts) that were causing health check failures\n2. Enhanced Automation Generation - Implemented full YAML code generation with safety validation, conflict detection, and energy impact estimation\n3. Improved Claude Code Integration - Added template-based automation generation that produces valid Home Assistant YAML\n\n**Current status:**\n- The scenario is fully functional with all P0 requirements complete.\n- The automation generation now produces valid, safe automations with comprehensive validation.\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Calendar service integration in fallback mode (not critical)\n- Full Claude Code AI generation not integrated (template generation works well)\n- Performance not tested at scale (>100 devices)\n- Some database schema references need qualification\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \nNone reported\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Health endpoint responding: `curl http://localhost:17845/health` returns proper status\n- Devices listing works: Returns 4 mock devices\n- Automation generation produces valid YAML with safety validation\n- All tests passing: `make test` completes successfully\n- Validation endpoint works with proper security checks"
