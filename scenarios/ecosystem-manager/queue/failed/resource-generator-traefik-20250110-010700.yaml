notes: '- **What it does:** Cloud-native reverse proxy and load balancer with automatic service discovery, dynamic configuration, and built-in observability. Simplifies routing, load balancing, and SSL management. - **Use when:** Need unified API gateway for all resources, automatic SSL certificates via Let''s Encrypt, service mesh capabilities, or advanced routing rules. Essential for production deployments. - **Technical requirements:** - Single binary or Docker container - Supports Docker, Kubernetes, Consul service discovery - Minimal CPU/memory footprint - Network access to backend services - Optional persistent storage for certificates'
