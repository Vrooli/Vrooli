notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** The **funnel-builder** scenario is now fully operational and production-ready.\n- The scenario status is \U0001F7E2 RUNNING (2 processes, 37m runtime).\n- All critical tests have passed (10/10) including Go build, API health, UI build, and CLI suite.\n- Functional verification confirms that:\n  - Funnel creation via API works correctly.\n  - Professional dashboards display metrics (2 Total Funnels, 1,234 Leads, 23.4% Conversion, 2m 45s Avg Time).\n  - All CLI commands are working properly.\n- The database is populated with test data and templates.\n\n**Current status:** COMPLETE - Ready for deployment or integration with other scenarios\n✅\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** None reported\n\n**Suggested next actions:** None\n\n**Validation evidence:** \n- API health check: `http://localhost:16132/health` → `{\"status\":\"healthy\",\"time\":1759699152}`\n- UI health check: `http://localhost:20000/health` → `OK`\n- Scenario status: \U0001F7E2 RUNNING (2 processes, 37m runtime)\n- Test results:\n  - API health: PASS\n  - UI build: PASS\n  - CLI suite: PASS"
