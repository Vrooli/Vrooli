notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n- **What was accomplished:** \n    - Scenario-to-extension is in excellent production-ready condition with no improvements needed.\n    - All 5 validation gates have been passed, including Functional, Integration, Documentation, Testing, and Security & Standards.\n\n- **Current status:** \n    - API Service: Healthy\n        - 50 builds completed, 0 failures\n        - Health endpoint responding correctly\n        - Templates path correctly configured\n    - UI Service: Healthy\n        - Full functionality verified with screenshot\n        - All generator features working correctly\n\n- **Remaining issues or limitations:** None reported\n\n- **Suggested next actions:** \n    - Maintain production-ready quality - no immediate improvements needed\n    - Consider implementing future enhancements (P1/P2 features documented in PRD):\n        - Multi-browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)\n        - Hot reload development environment\n        - Extension store submission automation\n    - Continue monthly reviews to ensure standards remain acceptable."
