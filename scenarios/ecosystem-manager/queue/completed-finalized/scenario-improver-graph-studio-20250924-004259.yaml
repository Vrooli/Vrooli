    Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Executed `claude` to review updated Consumer Terms and Privacy Policy
    - Ran health monitor for claude-code with PID 1215429 and interval 30s
    - Validation of Graph-studio scenario complete, including functional testing (Unit, Integration, API, CLI, UI) and code quality checks (ESLint passing with zero warnings)
    - Documentation thorough, including PRD.md, README.md, PROBLEMS.md, and Makefile

    **Current status:**
    - Scenario running stable for 16+ hours
    - No regressions detected
    - All security features intact (permissions, validation, parameterized queries)
    - CLI binary permissions fixed and working

    **Remaining issues or limitations:** None reported

    **Suggested next actions:** None

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Test suite results: all phases passing (34/34 tests)
    - API health confirmed healthy (`{"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","plugins_loaded":7,"plugins_active":4}`)
    - Code quality checks: ESLint 0 warnings, Go fmt/vet clean
    ```bash
    # Test suite: All phases passing
    make test
    # Result: All test phases passed! (34/34)

    # API health: Confirmed healthy
    curl http://localhost:18707/health
    # Result: {"status":"healthy","version":"1.0.0","plugins_loaded":7,"plugins_active":4}

    # Code quality: Zero warnings
    make check
    # Result: ESLint 0 warnings, Go fmt/vet clean
    ```
