notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n### What was accomplished\n- Validated SageMath Resource: Confirmed fully operational with all 10 PRD requirements (P0/P1/P2) functioning at 100%\n- Fixed Parallel Compute Output: Resolved undefined `error` function and missing result output in parallel.sh \n- Verified All Features: All mathematical computation, Jupyter integration, GPU detection, parallel processing, export capabilities, caching, and visualization features working correctly\n- Confirmed v2.0 Compliance: Full Universal Contract compliance with all required commands and structure\n- Comprehensive Testing: All test suites pass (smoke, unit, integration) with 100% success rate\n\n### Current status\n- Status: Fully Working/Production-Ready\n- Test Results: All tests pass without any failures\n- No Regressions: All existing functionality preserved and enhanced\n- v2.0 Compliance: Complete contract compliance maintained\n- Health Check Performance: Responds in <1 second (~815ms)\n\n### Validation evidence\n```bash\nvrooli resource sagemath test all        # ✅ All tests pass\nresource-sagemath parallel compute --cores 4 \"sum(i^2 for i in range(1000))\"  # ✅ Returns: 332833500\nresource-sagemath gpu check             # ✅ GPU detected (RTX 4070 Ti SUPER)\nresource-sagemath health                # ✅ Responds in 815ms\nresource-sagemath parallel status       # ✅ Shows 32 cores available\n```\n\n### Specific improvements made today\n1. Fixed undefined `error` function in parallel.sh that was causing silent failures\n2. Added proper result output to parallel compute commands \n3. Verified and documented complete production readiness\n\nThe SageMath resource is **100% complete** and production-ready with all P0, P1, and P2 requirements fully functional."
