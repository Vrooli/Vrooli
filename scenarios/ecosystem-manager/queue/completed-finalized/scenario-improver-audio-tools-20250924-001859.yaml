notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n✅ Comprehensive validation of the audio-tools scenario confirms it is fully production-ready:\n- All 14 integration tests passing (100% success rate)\n- All 16 Go unit tests passing with good coverage  \n- CLI properly installed and functional (v1.0.0)\n- API health check confirmed - service running and healthy\n- All 8 P0 requirements verified working with sub-100ms response times\n\n**Current status:**\nWorking/Improved - The scenario is in excellent condition:\n- No regressions found - all previously reported features continue working\n- The timeout issue with non-existent files is actually resolved (returns error in <1 second)\n- Performance meets all targets (>10x real-time processing)\n- Complete documentation suite (API, OpenAPI spec, CLI, formats guides)\n- One P1 feature (Voice Activity Detection) fully operational\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\nNone reported\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\nNone\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- **Test Results**: 38 total tests passing (14 integration + 16 unit + 8 CLI)\n- **Health Check**: API responding on port 19633 with all services operational\n- **PRD Compliance**: 100% of P0 requirements implemented and tested\n- **Performance**: Operations complete in <100ms for typical files\n- **Documentation**: Professional-grade docs covering all aspects"
