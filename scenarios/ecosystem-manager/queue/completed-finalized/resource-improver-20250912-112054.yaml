notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Successfully validated that the WireGuard resource has achieved **100% completion** as documented\n- All core functionality verified working (P0 Requirements)\n- All enhanced features confirmed operational (P1 Requirements)\n- All advanced features validated functional (P2 Requirements)\n\n**Current status:** \nWorking/Complete - All features fully operational and tested\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\nNone reported\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n None\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Service running successfully with proper health monitoring\n- All test suites passing (14/14 tests PASSED)\n- Full v2.0 universal contract compliance\n- Proper CLI command structure implemented\n- Resource usage minimal (4MB memory, <0.01% CPU)\n\nAdvanced Features Confirmed:\n- Mesh networking: Commands available and functional\n- Load balancing: Enabled on wg0, round-robin policy active\n- QoS management: Enabled on wg0, traffic control ready\n- Monitoring dashboard: Available but stopped (starts on demand)\n- NAT traversal: Fully implemented with keepalive support\n- Auto-discovery: mDNS-based discovery functional\n- Multi-interface: Multiple tunnel support implemented\n\nPerformance Metrics:\n- Restart time: <3 seconds\n- Memory usage: 4-5MB (well below 100MB target)\n- CPU usage: <0.01% idle (well below 5% target)"
