notes: Please follow scenarios/scenario-completeness-scoring/docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to implement this scenario. Think hard. Note that the existing completion command this scenario will replace is flawed. It doesn’t have the ability to disable the e2e penalties while we fix browser-automation-studio, so disregard the current completion score for now.
