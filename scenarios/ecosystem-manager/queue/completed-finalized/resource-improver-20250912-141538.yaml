notes: |-
    Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - The Mathlib resource is fully complete with all requirements implemented.
    - P0 requirements: 100% complete (all 6 requirements)
    - P1 requirements: 100% complete (all 4 requirements)
    - P2 requirements: 100% complete (all 3 requirements)
    - Overall progress: 100% (improved from initial 90%)

    **Current status:**
    - The resource is fully functional with all requirements complete.
    - Status: Fully functional
    - Key Features: Lean 4 runtime, proof verification, batch processing, caching, REPL, custom tactics

    **Remaining issues or limitations:** None reported

    **Suggested next actions:** None

    **Validation evidence:**
    - All tests pass: 3/3 test suites successful
    - Lean 4.23.0 installed and operational
    - Proof verification API fully functional
    - Batch processing working with parallel execution
    - Cache management with LRU eviction operational
    - Performance metrics tracking and reporting
    - Interactive REPL mode implemented
    - Custom tactics loading and management implemented
    - v2.0 contract fully compliant
