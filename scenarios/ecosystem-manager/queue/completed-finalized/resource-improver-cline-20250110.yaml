notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Comprehensive validation confirming Cline resource is production-ready\n- All tests passing: smoke (6/6), unit (13/13), integration (7/7) - 100% success rate\n- v2.0 contract fully compliant with all required commands\n- Updated PROBLEMS.md to reflect accurate current test status (100% passing)\n- PRD requirements verified: P0 (7/7), P1 (4/4), P2 (3/3) - 100% complete\n\n**Current status:** Working/improved - Production-ready with all features fully operational\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** None reported\n\n**Suggested next actions:** None\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n✅ All test suites passing (26/26 tests, 100% success)\n✅ Integration Hub functional (7 resources available, 2 connected)\n✅ Cache system operational\n✅ Provider switching works correctly (ollama ↔ openrouter)\n✅ Model listing functional\n✅ Error handling validates invalid inputs\n✅ Documentation accurate and complete\n\n```bash\n# Test results: 100% passing\n- Smoke tests: 6/6 passed\n- Unit tests: 13/13 passed  \n- Integration tests: 7/7 passed\n- v2.0 commands: 15 found (all required)\n- Integrations: 2 connected (Ollama, Judge0)\n```"

The Cline resource is indeed production-ready. Let me create a final summary of the validation:\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What was accomplished:\n- ✅ Comprehensive validation confirming Cline resource is production-ready\n- ✅ All tests passing: smoke (6/6), unit (13/13), integration (7/7) - 100% success rate\n- ✅ v2.0 contract fully compliant with all required commands\n- ✅ Updated PROBLEMS.md to reflect accurate current test status (100% passing)\n- ✅ PRD requirements verified: P0 (7/7), P1 (4/4), P2 (3/3) - 100% complete\n\n### Current status:\n**Working/improved - Production-ready with all features fully operational**\n\n### Validation evidence:\n✅ All test suites passing (26/26 tests, 100% success)\n✅ Integration Hub functional (7 resources available, 2 connected)\n✅ Cache system operational\n✅ Provider switching works correctly (ollama ↔ openrouter)\n✅ Model listing functional\n✅ Error handling validates invalid inputs\n✅ Documentation accurate and complete\n\n### Key findings:\n- The resource was already production-ready as claimed\n- Only minor documentation update was needed (PROBLEMS.md test status)\n- All P0, P1, and P2 requirements are fully implemented and working\n- The resource handles the absence of VS Code gracefully for headless environments\n\n### Remaining issues or limitations:\nNone - The Cline resource is fully functional and production-ready.\n\n### Specific evidence that validates the work:\n```bash\n# Test results: 100% passing\n- Smoke tests: 6/6 passed\n- Unit tests: 13/13 passed  \n- Integration tests: 7/7 passed\n- v2.0 commands: 15 found (all required)\n- Integrations: 2 connected (Ollama, Judge0)\n```\n\nThe Cline resource requires no further improvements and is ready for production use.\n"
