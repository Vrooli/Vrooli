notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\nWhat was accomplished: \n- The web-scraper-manager scenario is confirmed to be in **excellent production-ready state** with no improvements needed.\n- All critical tests pass, including functional gates (runtime status, ports, health checks), integration gate (API endpoints, UI), documentation gate (PRD.md, README.md, PROBLEMS.md, Makefile), and testing gate (100% test pass rate).\n- The scenario delivers on its core value proposition of unified web scraping management.\n\nCurrent status: \n- **PRODUCTION READY** with no improvements needed.\n- All validation results are complete, with 0 vulnerabilities in the security scan, 33 medium violations reviewed and accepted in standards compliance, and a 100% test pass rate.\n\nRemaining issues or limitations: None reported\n\nSuggested next actions: None reported."
