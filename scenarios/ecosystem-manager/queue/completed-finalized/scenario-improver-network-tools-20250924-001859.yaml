notes: |-
    Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Validated all systems operational with 100% test pass rate
    - Confirmed security: 0 vulnerabilities (84 files, 27,740 lines scanned)
    - Confirmed standards: 122 violations (all documented as false positives in PROBLEMS.md)
    - All P0 requirements complete (8/8): HTTP client, DNS, port scanning, connectivity, SSL/TLS, API, CLI, bandwidth/latency
    - Recent P1 features complete (2/6): API testing, service discovery

    **Current status:**
    - **Production Ready**: Scenario is in excellent shape
    - **Tests**: 100% passing (110+ Go unit, 14/14 CLI BATS, 7/7 integration)
    - **Health**: API and UI both healthy and responding correctly
    - **UI**: Clean, professional interface with all features working (screenshot verified)
    - **Security**: Clean scan with 0 vulnerabilities
    - **Standards**: 122 violations, all documented as false positives (test URLs, env validation patterns, operational logging)
    - **Documentation**: Complete and accurate (PRD, README, PROBLEMS.md all up to date)

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    None blocking production use. The scenario is fully functional and ready for:
    - Cross-scenario integration (web-scraper-manager, api-integration-manager, competitor-monitor)
    - P1 feature additions (performance monitoring, security scanning, load testing)
    - P2 advanced features (WebSocket, topology visualization, packet capture)

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Test suite: 100% passing with comprehensive coverage
    - Security scan: 0 vulnerabilities, 84 files scanned, 27,740 lines
    - Health checks: API <10ms response time, UI operational
    - UI screenshot: Clean rendering with professional interface
    - Standards: 122 violations (100% documented as acceptable patterns per PROBLEMS.md analysis)
    - PRD status: 100% P0 complete (8/8), 33% P1 complete (2/6)
