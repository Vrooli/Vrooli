notes: |-
    Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    What was accomplished:
    - Fixed Critical API Issue: The parameter sweep endpoint was broken due to incorrect function signature. Fixed by updating to accept JSON body instead of query parameters.
    - Rebuilt Docker Image: Successfully rebuilt the Docker container with the corrected API server code.
    - Validated All P0 Requirements:
      - Docker Package: Working (3.59GB image)
      - Health Check: Responds in <500ms
      - Lifecycle Management: All commands functional
      - CLI Commands: Simulations and exports working
      - Canonical Templates: Three templates available
      - Result Persistence: API supports with fallback
      - Smoke Tests: All passing
    - Documentation Updates:
      - Updated PRD with Phase 4 improvements
      - Created PROBLEMS.md documenting issues and solutions
      - Verified README accuracy
    - Test Results:
      - Smoke Tests: 5/5 passing
      - Integration Tests: 6/6 passing (fixed from 5/6)
      - Unit Tests: 5/5 passing

    Current status:
    - P0 Completion: 100% (7/7 requirements working)
    - P1 Completion: 0% (future work)
    - P2 Completion: 0% (future work)
    - Overall Health: Fully operational

    Remaining issues or limitations: None reported

    Suggested next actions: None

    Validation evidence:
    ```bash
    # All tests passing
    vrooli resource meep test all  # Result: 16/16 tests pass

    # Health check working
    curl http://localhost:8193/health  # <500ms response

    # Parameter sweep fixed
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8193/batch/sweep  # Now working
    ```
