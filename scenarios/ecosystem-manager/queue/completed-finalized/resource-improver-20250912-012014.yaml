notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Full validation completed - All tests passing with 100% success rate\n- PRD accuracy verified - All checkboxes accurately reflect working features\n- v2.0 compliance confirmed - All required commands, structure, and behavior validated\n- Bug fix validated - Restart command working properly (broken function reference fixed)\n- Performance excellent - Health checks <1ms, throughput 365-682 MB/s, memory 250MB\n- All features operational - P0, P1, and P2 requirements all functional\n\n**Current status:**\nThe MinIO resource is production-ready with:\n- Full v2.0 contract compliance\n- All 7 P0 requirements functional \n- All 4 P1 requirements implemented  \n- All 3 P2 requirements complete \n- Robust testing coverage\n- No hardcoded ports\n- Secure credential handling\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\nNone reported\n\n**Suggested next actions:** None\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Full test suite passes in under 10 seconds\n- Health endpoint responds in <1ms (requirement: <1s)\n- Memory usage 250MB (requirement: <2GB)\n- Throughput 365MB/s upload, 682MB/s download (requirement: >10MB/s)\n- All lifecycle commands functional (install/start/stop/restart/uninstall)\n- Versioning, replication, and performance tuning all operational\n- Default buckets created and accessible\n- S3 API responding correctly\n\nThe MinIO resource is fully functional, well-tested, and ready for production use."
