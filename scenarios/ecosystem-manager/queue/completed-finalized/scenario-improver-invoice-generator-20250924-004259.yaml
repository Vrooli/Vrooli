notes: |-
    Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    What was accomplished:
    - The invoice-generator scenario has successfully completed comprehensive validation.
    - All validation gates passed with 100% feature completion and zero security vulnerabilities.
    - Professional invoice generation, AI-powered text extraction, automated calculations, PDF export, payment status tracking, client information management, and recurring invoice automation are all complete.

    Current status:
    - The scenario is production ready.
    - No blocking issues exist.
    - The scenario demonstrates comprehensive business functionality with professional UI, robust testing, and clean security posture.

    Remaining issues or limitations:
    None reported

    Suggested next actions: None
    Validation evidence:
    - All 5 validation gates passed:
        - Functional: all lifecycle commands working (start, status, test, logs, stop)
        - Integration: API, UI, PostgreSQL, Ollama, Browserless all operational
        - Documentation: PRD, README, PROBLEMS, Makefile all complete
        - Testing: 100% test pass rate (Makefile: 2/2, CLI: 15/15, Go: all passing)
        - Security & Standards: 0 vulnerabilities, 0 critical violations
    - P0 Requirements: 7/7 (100%) completed
    - P1 Requirements: 5/5 (100%) completed
