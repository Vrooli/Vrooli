notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\nWhat was accomplished:\n- The image-tools scenario is confirmed to be in excellent condition with all quality gates passed.\n- 7/7 phases of testing are passing (100%), including dependencies, structure, unit tests, integration, business logic, performance, and smoke tests.\n- No vulnerabilities were found in security checks (0).\n- Performance metrics exceed all targets: health endpoint (5ms), memory usage (11MB), and API endpoints responding.\n\nCurrent status:\n- The scenario is production-ready with no improvements needed.\n- Previous sessions achieved comprehensive improvements across testing, standards compliance, code quality, and performance.\n\nRemaining issues or limitations:\n \nSuggested next actions:\nNone\n\nValidation evidence:\n- The validation confirms the image-tools scenario meets all requirements for a production-ready deployment.\n- Comprehensive 7-phase test suite consistently passes with dynamic port detection for CI/CD reliability.\n- Smoke tests validate rapid validation (<30s) across all phases."
