    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**

    - Fixed critical missing route: Git integration handler existed but wasn't wired to API
    - Added endpoint: `POST /api/v1/issues/{id}/create-pr` in api/main.go:2560
    - Verified endpoint responds correctly (returns proper error when no investigation data present)
    - Requires GITHUB_TOKEN, GITHUB_OWNER, GITHUB_REPO environment variables to function

    **Current status:**
    Working - All P0 requirements verified, 3 of 4 P1 requirements complete

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**

    - ✅ Git Integration - Now wired and accessible (requires GitHub credentials to execute)
    - ✅ Export Functions - Fully working (JSON, CSV, Markdown)
    - ✅ Web UI - Running and functional
    - ❌ Semantic Search - Blocked by Qdrant availability (not a code issue)

    **Known Gaps:**

    - P2 requirements not implemented (performance analytics, multi-agent support, webhooks)
    - UI automation tests not present in test suite
    - Security features implemented but disabled by default (production consideration)

    **Auditor Findings (from previous session):**
    - 1 security issue identified (not blocking, likely related to default open CORS)
    - 489 standards violations (mostly style/documentation, not functional issues)

    **Validation evidence:**

    ```bash
    # API health verification
    curl -sf http://localhost:19751/health
    # Result: {"success":true,"message":"App Issue Tracker API is healthy",...}

    # Git integration endpoint test
    curl -X POST http://localhost:19751/api/v1/issues/issue-ae9a67a6/create-pr
    # Result: {"success":false,"message":"No fixes available for this issue. Run investigation first."}
    # (Correct behavior - requires investigation to be run first)

    # Export functionality tests
    curl -sf "http://localhost:19751/api/v1/export?format=json&status=open" | jq '.count'
    # Result: 2 issues exported

    curl -sf "http://localhost:19751/api/v1/export?format=csv&status=open" | head -2
    # Result: Proper CSV headers and data

    curl -sf "http://localhost:19751/api/v1/export?format=markdown&status=open" | head -5
    # Result: Formatted markdown with issue details

    # Build verification
    cd api && go build -o /tmp/test-build .
    # Result: ✅ Build successful

    # Test suite
    ./test/phases/test-unit.sh
    # Result: ✅ test-unit.sh completed successfully
    ```

    **Suggested next actions:**

    1. **Production deployment**: Enable security features (ENABLE_AUTH=true, configure API_TOKENS)
    2. **Git integration testing**: Set up GitHub credentials and test end-to-end PR creation
    3. **UI automation tests**: Add test suite for React frontend
    4. **Address auditor findings**: Review and remediate the 1 security issue and high-priority standards violations
    5. **Performance analytics**: Implement P2 requirement for tracking resolution metrics
