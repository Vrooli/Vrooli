notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Thoroughly assessed Airbyte resource implementation and confirmed production readiness\n- Validated all 17 requirements (7 P0, 6 P1, 4 P2) are fully functional\n- Confirmed 100% test pass rate across smoke, integration, and unit test suites\n- Verified v2.0 contract compliance with all required CLI commands working\n- Confirmed abctl deployment healthy with 8 Kubernetes pods running\n- Validated webapp accessible on port 8002 and API health checks passing\n- Verified CDK, workspace, and metrics P2 features are functional\n- Confirmed zero shellcheck warnings or errors in all library files\n- Updated PRD with final validation status\n\n**Current status:**\nProduction-ready - The Airbyte resource is fully optimized and operational with:\n- All 17 PRD requirements functioning correctly (100% completion)\n- abctl Kubernetes deployment running successfully  \n- Health checks and webapp accessible\n- Full v2.0 contract compliance\n- Clean codebase with no shellcheck issues\n- Complete test suite passing with 100% success rate\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n✅ All tests pass: smoke, integration, and unit tests confirm full functionality\n✅ Status command shows healthy cluster with all pods running\n✅ Webapp accessible on port 8002\n✅ CLI interface fully implements v2.0 contract requirements\n✅ P2 features (CDK, workspace, metrics) confirmed working\n✅ No code quality issues detected by shellcheck\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\nNone reported\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\nNone\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n✅ All tests pass: smoke, integration, and unit tests confirm full functionality\n✅ Status command shows healthy cluster with all pods running\n✅ Webapp accessible on port 8002\n✅ CLI interface fully implements v2.0 contract requirements\n✅ P2 features (CDK, workspace, metrics) confirmed working\n✅ No code quality issues detected by shellcheck"
