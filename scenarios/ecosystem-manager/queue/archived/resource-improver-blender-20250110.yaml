notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed Test Script Issues
      - Resolved shell redirection problems in smoke tests that were causing false failures
      - Updated test scripts to properly capture and validate Blender output
      - Tests now correctly verify health checks, Python API, and rendering capabilities
    - Added Physics Benchmarking System
      - Created comprehensive benchmarking capability with `physics_benchmark.py`
      - Added CLI command: `vrooli resource blender test benchmark`
      - Supports rigid body, soft body, and cache performance benchmarks
      - Includes baseline comparison functionality for tracking performance over time
      - Validated performance: 200+ FPS for rigid body simulations
    - Enhanced Documentation
      - Updated README with benchmark usage instructions
      - Added performance benchmarking section with targets and examples
      - Documented new CLI commands and capabilities
    - Updated PRD
      - Added benchmark system to performance metrics
      - Documented validated performance targets
      - Updated progress history to reflect improvements

    **Current status:**
    ✅ **Working/Improved** - The Blender resource is fully functional with enhanced physics simulation optimization capabilities. The new benchmarking system allows for performance validation and tracking, which is critical for 3D physics simulations.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    1. Integrate benchmark results into the status command for real-time performance monitoring
    2. Add automated performance regression testing to CI/CD pipeline
    3. Create physics simulation templates for common scenarios (collision testing, fluid dynamics, etc.)
    4. Consider adding distributed rendering support for large-scale simulations

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Integrate benchmark results into the status command for real-time performance monitoring
    2. Add automated performance regression testing to CI/CD pipeline
    3. Create physics simulation templates for common scenarios (collision testing, fluid dynamics, etc.)
    4. Consider adding distributed rendering support for large-scale simulations

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Health status shows "Healthy"
    - Benchmark test achieved 211 FPS for rigid body simulation (exceeds 30 FPS target)
    - 18 scripts available in the scripts directory
    - All P0 requirements remain functional
