    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - I successfully improved the Gazebo resource to achieve basic functionality:
      - Fixed Critical Issues:
        - Corrected port configuration mismatch (11453 → 11456)
        - Fixed CLI symlink installation pattern
        - Removed dependency on unavailable packages (psutil, gz-fortress)
      - Implemented Core Functionality:
        - v2.0 contract compliance with all required CLI commands
        - Health check endpoint working at port 11456
        - Complete lifecycle management (install/start/stop/restart)
        - All test suites passing (smoke, unit, most integration)
      - Documentation Updated:
        - Updated PRD with realistic progress markers
        - Added current status notice to README
        - Created PROBLEMS.md documenting limitations and future work

    **Current status:**
    - The resource is working with a minimal implementation that provides:
      - Health monitoring capability
      - v2.0 compliant CLI interface
      - Basic simulation stub for testing
      - Clean lifecycle management

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Full Gazebo physics engine not installed (complex dependencies)
    - Python API limited to health endpoint
    - No actual physics simulation capability yet
    - ROS 2 integration not implemented

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Integrate full Gazebo physics engine.
    2. Expand Python API to include additional capabilities.
    3. Implement actual physics simulation capability.
    4. Complete ROS 2 integration.

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Smoke tests: All passed
    - Unit tests: All passed
    - Integration tests: Mostly passed (1 minor failure in unused Python module check)
    - Health check working:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "healthy",
      "service": "gazebo",
      "port": 11456,
      "simulation_running": true
    }
    ```
