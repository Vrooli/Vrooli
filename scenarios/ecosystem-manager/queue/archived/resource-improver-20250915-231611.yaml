notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Implemented Vault Integration with VaultClient class, guardian key storage, and API endpoints
    - Completed all P0 requirements (100% complete)
    - Implemented Database Export APIs for PostgreSQL and QuestDB export
    - Enhanced health check to show Vault connection status
    - Added CLI commands for export operations
    - Implemented full command-line interface for election management

    **Current status:**
    - ElectionGuard resource now provides secure key management, analytics ready export capabilities, production-ready environment, and integration points
    - Working features include complete election lifecycle management, Vault-secured guardian keys, database export capabilities, and comprehensive test coverage
    - P1 items remaining for future improvement include automation workflows, guardian health monitoring commands, audit discrepancy detection, and verifiable receipt publishing system

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - P1 items:
      - Automation workflows (n8n/Windmill) for precinct simulation
      - Guardian health monitoring commands
      - Audit discrepancy detection
      - Verifiable receipt publishing system
    - P2 items:
      - Connectors for civic engagement scenarios
      - Risk-limiting audit hooks
      - Mesa integration for social trust simulations
      - Human-readable report generation
      - UI helpers for election management
      - Multi-language ballot support

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Address remaining P1 and P2 items to further improve ElectionGuard resource's functionality and usability
    - Complete automation workflows, guardian health monitoring commands, audit discrepancy detection, and verifiable receipt publishing system

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Completed Improvements (60% → 85%)
    - ✅ **Vault Integration**, ✅ **All P0 requirements**, and ✅ **Database Export APIs** are marked as completed
    - Technical implementation details for Vault Integration, Database Export, and CLI Enhancements are provided
