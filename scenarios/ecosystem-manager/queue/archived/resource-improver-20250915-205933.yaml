notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n\n- Fixed verify command - Resolved the `--read-data-subset` issue where it was incorrectly using snapshot IDs instead of percentages.\n- Added multi-backend support:\n  - Local filesystem (default)\n  - S3 and MinIO\n  - SFTP\n  - REST server\n  - Proper backend configuration with validation\n- Added database backup hooks for:\n  - PostgreSQL databases (full or specific databases)\n  - Redis data (using BGSAVE)\n  - MinIO buckets (full or specific buckets)\n- Updated PRD accuracy:\n  - Corrected checkboxes to reflect actual implementation:\n    - Content management commands were already working\n    - All P1 requirements are now completed\n- Enhanced documentation: Updated README with:\n  - New backup commands and hooks\n  - Backend configuration examples\n  - Complete feature list\n\n**Current status:**\n\n*   **P0 Requirements:** 7/7 (100%) \n*   **P1 Requirements:** 5/5 (100%)\n*   **P2 Requirements:** 0/3 (0%)\n\nThe restic resource is now production ready with all critical and important features implemented.\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n\n- Backup encryption key rotation\n- Bandwidth throttling for network backups\n- Integration with monitoring systems for alerts\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n\n*   Implement backup encryption key rotation\n*   Add bandwidth throttling for network backups\n*   Integrate with monitoring systems for alerts"
