notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Implemented major enhancements to the Strapi resource, including S3/MinIO Storage Integration, Backup/Restore Functionality, Enhanced Docker Support, and CLI Enhancements.
    - Added documentation updates with progress history and detailed changes.

    **Current status:**
    - P0 Requirements: 50% complete (3/6)
      - Health Check Endpoint
      - Basic Lifecycle Commands
      - Environment Configuration
      - PostgreSQL Integration (requires running PostgreSQL)
      - Admin Panel Access (requires installation)
      - REST API (requires running instance)
    - P1 Requirements: 50% complete (2/4)
      - S3 Storage Integration
      - Backup/Restore
      - GraphQL API
      - Multi-environment Support

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Complete GraphQL configuration and testing
    - Add multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
    - Implement content import/export functionality
    - Add webhook support for external integrations
    - Create example content type templates

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Complete GraphQL configuration and testing
    2. Add multi-environment support (dev/staging/prod)
    3. Implement content import/export functionality
    4. Add webhook support for external integrations
    5. Create example content type templates

    **Validation evidence:**
