notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Validated all claimed P0 and P1 requirements against actual implementation\n- Verified all test suites passing (100% pass rate)\n- Confirmed ACME protocol fully operational at https://localhost:9010/acme/acme/directory\n- Validated HSM/KMS configuration templates functional\n- Confirmed certificate templates system working with 2 active templates\n- Updated PRD.md with accurate progress tracking and validation status\n- Enhanced PROBLEMS.md with 2025-09-26 validation findings\n\n**Current status:**\nWorking and stable - Resource is production-ready with comprehensive PKI capabilities\n- All P0 requirements (7/7) fully implemented and verified\n- All P1 requirements (5/5) implemented with appropriate fallbacks for external dependencies\n- v2.0 contract fully compliant\n- No regressions introduced\n\n**Remaining limitations:**\n- PostgreSQL backend configured but requires postgres resource running for full database features (gracefully falls back to file storage)\n- Direct certificate issuance via CLI requires interactive password (ACME protocol provides automated alternative)\n- Full HSM/KMS integration requires actual hardware/cloud service (configuration templates provided)\n\n**Suggested next actions:** None\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```\n✅ Unit tests: 4/4 passing\n✅ Smoke tests: 4/4 passing  \n✅ Integration tests: 10/10 passing\n✅ Validation tests: 10/10 passing\n✅ ACME endpoint: Accessible and responding\n✅ Health monitoring: Operational\n✅ 3 provisioners configured\n✅ 2 certificate templates active\n```"
