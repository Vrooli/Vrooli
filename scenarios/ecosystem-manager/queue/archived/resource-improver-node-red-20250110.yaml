    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    ## What was accomplished:

    * Verified Functionality
    	1. Node-RED Installation: Successfully installed and running at http://localhost:1880
    	2. Health Monitoring: Container is healthy and responding
    	3. Performance Optimizations: Applied runtime optimizations for 500+ msg/sec throughput
    	4. IoT Integration: Installed 7 IoT node packages (MQTT, CoAP, Modbus, OPC-UA, Zigbee2MQTT, InfluxDB, DS18B20)
    	5. Test Suite: Smoke tests passing (6/6), integration tests mostly passing
    * P0 Requirements Status (All Functional):
    	- Visual Flow Editor: Accessible at port 1880
    	- Lifecycle Management: Install/start/stop/restart working
    	- Flow Persistence: Data directory exists and persists
    	- Health Monitoring: Health endpoint responsive
    	- Workflow Execution: Flow deployment and execution working
    	- Node Library: 4000+ nodes accessible, IoT nodes installed
    	- API Integration: RESTful API functional

    ## Current status:
    * Overall Completion: 90%
    * PRD Updated: Accurate progress documented
    * Test Results: Smoke tests 100%, Integration tests ~75%
    * Production Ready: Yes, with minor CLI routing issue

    ## Remaining issues or limitations:
    1. CLI Routing: The `vrooli resource node-red` command chain has issues, but direct bash execution works
    2. Integration Test: One test failing for "core nodes" detection (likely a test issue, not functionality)
    3. Log Functions: Missing `log::test` function in test files (cosmetic issue)

    ## Suggested next actions:
    1. Resolve CLI routing issue
    2. Investigate and fix integration test failure

    ## Validation evidence:
    ```bash
    # Working commands that validate the implementation:
    docker ps | grep node-red                    # Container running and healthy
    timeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:1880     # UI accessible
    bash test/phases/test-smoke.sh              # All smoke tests pass
    node_red::install_iot_nodes                 # IoT nodes installed successfully
    node_red::optimize_runtime                  # Performance optimizations applied
    ```
