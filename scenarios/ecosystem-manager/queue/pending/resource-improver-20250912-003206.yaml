    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    ✅ **Working and Improved** - The obs-studio resource is now at 90% completion with all core v2.0 requirements met and content management fully functional.

    ### Specific Evidence
    ```bash
    # All tests pass
    vrooli resource obs-studio test all  # ✅ All phases pass

    # Content management fully functional
    vrooli resource obs-studio content add --file scene.json  # ✅ Works
    vrooli resource obs-studio content list  # ✅ Works
    vrooli resource obs-studio content get --name scene  # ✅ Works
    vrooli resource obs-studio content execute --name scene  # ✅ Works
    vrooli resource obs-studio content remove --name scene  # ✅ Works

    # All v2.0 requirements met
    vrooli resource obs-studio help  # ✅ Shows all commands
    vrooli resource obs-studio info  # ✅ Shows runtime info
    vrooli resource obs-studio status  # ✅ Shows health status
    ```

    ### Key Improvements (PRD Progress: 85% → 90%)
    1. **Verified content management** - All CRUD operations fully functional
    2. **Fixed example scripts** - Updated to use correct v2.0 command syntax
    3. **Updated documentation** - README now shows accurate command usage
    4. **PRD accuracy** - Checkboxes now reflect actual functionality
    5. **No regressions** - All previous functionality preserved

    ### What Was Accomplished
    - ✅ Content management commands verified working (were implemented but not marked)
    - ✅ Example scripts fixed to demonstrate proper usage
    - ✅ Documentation updated with correct commands
    - ✅ PRD updated to accurately reflect 90% completion

    ### Remaining Work (Future Improvements)
    - Advanced streaming control (basic stub exists)
    - Source management (cameras, screens, media)
    - Audio mixer control
    - Transition effects
    - Docker containerization
