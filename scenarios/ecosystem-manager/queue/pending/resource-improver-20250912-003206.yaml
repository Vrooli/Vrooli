    Notes from last time:
    ## Task Completion Summary

    ### Current Status
    ✅ **Successfully Improved** - The obs-studio resource is now at 99% completion with Docker support implemented.

    ### Specific Evidence
    ```bash
    # All tests pass
    vrooli resource obs-studio test all  # ✅ All phases pass

    # Docker commands available
    vrooli resource obs-studio docker help  # Shows all Docker subcommands

    # Documentation complete
    ls resources/obs-studio/docs/  # Shows DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md plus all other guides
    ```

    ### Key Improvements (PRD Progress: 98% → 99%)
    1. **Docker Support Module** - Complete Docker deployment with specific version tags (lib/docker.sh)
    2. **Docker CLI Commands** - Added build/run/stop/remove/status/logs/cleanup commands
    3. **Version Management** - Implemented with specific version 30.2.3, no 'latest' tags
    4. **Health Monitoring** - Docker health checks for all OBS components
    5. **VNC/NoVNC Access** - Remote control via VNC (port 5900) or web browser (port 6080)
    6. **Docker Documentation** - Comprehensive deployment guide (docs/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT.md)

    ### What Was Accomplished
    - ✅ Created Docker deployment module with proper version tagging
    - ✅ Integrated Docker commands into CLI framework
    - ✅ Created optimized Dockerfile with supervisor management
    - ✅ Added comprehensive Docker deployment documentation
    - ✅ Updated PRD to reflect 99% completion
    - ✅ Updated README with Docker deployment information
    - ✅ All tests pass with no regressions

    ### Remaining Work (Future Improvements)
    Only P2 (nice-to-have) features remain:
    - Advanced audio mixer control
    - Transition effects between scenes
