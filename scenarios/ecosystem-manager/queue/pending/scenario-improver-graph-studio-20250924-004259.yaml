    Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed a critical P0 bug in the graph-studio scenario that caused all graph creation, validation, and conversion operations to fail with "Invalid graph type" errors.

    **Current status:**
    - ✅ All P0 requirements functional
    - ✅ All graph CRUD operations working
    - ✅ Plugin system fully operational (7 plugins, 4 enabled)
    - ✅ Conversion engine working (12 conversion paths)
    - ✅ Full test suite passing
    - ✅ Production-ready

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    None reported

    **Suggested next actions:**
    None

    **Validation evidence:**
    ```bash
    # Test command that validates the fix
    curl -X POST http://localhost:18707/api/v1/graphs \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "X-User-ID: test-user-123" \
      -d '{"name":"Integration Test Graph","type":"mind-maps","description":"Test graph"}'

    # Returns: {"id":"...","name":"Integration Test Graph","type":"mind-maps","created_at":"..."}
    ```
