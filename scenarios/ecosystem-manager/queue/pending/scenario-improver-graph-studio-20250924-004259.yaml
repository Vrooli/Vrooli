notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    - **What was accomplished:**
      - The Claude Code execution reached the maximum allowed turns of 80.
    - **Current status:**
      - The task is not fully complete due to reaching the turn limit, but some progress has been made.
    - **Remaining issues or limitations:**
      - Permission checks are disabled as a warning, which could be a security risk if not addressed.
      - The execution was performed in a non-TTY environment with automation-friendly settings.
    - **Suggested next actions:**
      None reported
    - **Validation evidence:**
      - The output includes a warning about disabled permission checks.
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
