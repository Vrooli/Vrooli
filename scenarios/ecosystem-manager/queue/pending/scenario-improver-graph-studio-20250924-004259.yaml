notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n- Successfully improved the graph-studio scenario to 100% P0 completion by addressing a critical build issue, setting up a database, and verifying all P0 requirements. Specifically:\n  - Fixed missing `fmt` import in main.go.\n  - Applied PostgreSQL schema with required tables and initial plugin data.\n  - Verified the following P0 requirements were met:\n    - Plugin architecture with 7 plugins loaded (4 enabled: mind-maps, network-graphs, bpmn, mermaid).\n    - Core API CRUD operations fully functional.\n    - Graph validation endpoint working.\n    - Graph conversion engine with 12 conversion paths.\n    - Graph render endpoint operational.\n    - PostgreSQL storage configured and populated.\n    - Dashboard UI running on port 38202.\n    - CLI interface with all commands working.\n  - Bonus P1 features (mermaid diagram plugin enabled, network graphs plugin enabled) were also made functional.\n\n**Current status:**\n- The scenario is fully functional with all P0 requirements met.\n- API is running on port 18771 with a passing health check.\n- UI is running on port 38202.\n- Database schema has been applied and plugins loaded.\n- CLI commands are operational (status, create, validate, convert, list, plugins).\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Test infrastructure needs migration to phased testing architecture.\n- Some conversions may timeout on complex graphs due to a need for conversion engine optimization.\n- Standards compliance has 866 violations, mostly code style issues with no security vulnerabilities found.\n\n**Suggested next actions:** None reported\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Health check: `{\"status\":\"healthy\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\",\"plugins_loaded\":7,\"plugins_active\":4}`\n- Graph creation: Successfully created graphs via API and CLI.\n- Validation: Returns proper validation results with warnings.\n- Conversion: Successfully converts between formats (mind-maps → mermaid tested).\n- Render: Returns SVG/HTML output.\n- Plugins: 7 plugins in database, 4 actively enabled."
