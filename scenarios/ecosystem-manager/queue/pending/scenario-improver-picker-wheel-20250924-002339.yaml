    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Executed Claude Code with automation-friendly settings due to non-TTY environment detection
    - Ran health monitor for claude-code (PID: 2946543, interval: 30s)
    - Executed command with specified flags and options (timeout 3600 claude --print --max-turns 40 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions)

    **Current status:**
    - Task terminated due to reaching max turns (40)
    - Reached the end of execution without additional errors

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Permission checks are disabled
    - Skipped maximum turns before completing analysis

    **Suggested next actions:** None reported
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (40). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
