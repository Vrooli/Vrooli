    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    - **What was accomplished:**
      - Validated all P0 (8/8) and P1 (6/6) requirements
      - Scenario passes all 6 test phases: unit, integration, structure, dependencies, business, performance
      - API and UI are fully operational: Health endpoint, agent discovery, cyberpunk UI all functioning
      - Agent discovery working: Successfully detecting multiple claude-code agents
      - Updated PRD with accurate progress: Corrected API endpoint documentation and added verification notes

    - **Current status:** The agent-dashboard scenario is fully functional with all P0 and P1 requirements complete. The scenario provides real-time monitoring of AI agents with a cyberpunk-themed UI featuring radar visualization.

    - **Remaining issues or limitations:**
      - API Documentation Discrepancy: Scan endpoint is at /api/v1/agents/scan not /api/v1/scan as documented
      - P2 Features Incomplete (2/5):
        - Agent capability matching/discovery not implemented
        - Custom radar themes UI exists but not connected to functionality

    - **Suggested next actions:** Implement remaining P2 features for 100% completion, add more resource support, consider adding the missing /api/v1/scan endpoint, hook up theme selector, and add capability matching.

    - **Validation evidence:**
      - `make test` passes all 6 test phases
      - API health check: curl http://localhost:19072/health returns healthy status
      - Agent discovery: curl http://localhost:19072/api/v1/agents returns 2-4 active agents
      - CLI working: ./cli/agent-dashboard list displays agent status
      - UI accessible at http://localhost:38762 with full cyberpunk theme
      - Screenshot captured at /tmp/agent-dashboard-ui.png
