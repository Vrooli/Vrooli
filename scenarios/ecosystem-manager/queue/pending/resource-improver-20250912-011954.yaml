    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    - **Working**: All functionality operational including new features
    - **Progress**: 45% → 65% (2 P1 requirements fully implemented)
    - **Tests**: All tests passing (smoke, integration, unit)

    ### Validation Evidence
    ```bash
    vrooli resource cncjs test all  # All tests pass including new features
    vrooli resource cncjs workflow list  # Workflow management working
    vrooli resource cncjs controller list  # Controller profiles working
    ```

    ### Lessons Learned
    - Workflow management provides significant value without hardware dependencies
    - Controller profiles enable better multi-machine support
    - Feature implementation without hardware is possible for management features
    - Export/import capabilities essential for production workflows

    ### Recommendations for Future Improvements
    1. **3D Visualization wrapper** - WebGL G-code path preview (P1 remaining)
    2. **Authentication token management** - For secure API access
    3. **Virtual controller mode** - For testing without hardware
    4. **Network controller support** - ESP32/Raspberry Pi connections
    5. **Camera integration** - Real-time monitoring (P2)
