notes: "- **What it does:** Containerized build system combining Dockerfile and Makefile concepts for reproducible, parallelized builds. Features automatic parallelization, intelligent layer caching, and 2-20x speed improvements with language-agnostic support and cross-repository target reuse.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need reproducible builds, CI/CD pipelines, monorepo management, or complex build orchestration. Perfect for teams seeking faster, more reliable builds with local-to-production parity.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - Docker-like syntax (Earthfile)
  - Container-based isolation
  - Automatic DAG construction
  - Layer caching and parallelization
  - Works with any CI/CD platform"
