    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    **Working/Improved** - The Huginn resource has achieved 93% completion, advancing from 78% to 93% overall.

    ### Key Improvements Made
    1. **Ollama Integration** (P2): AI-powered event filtering with full Ollama API support
       - Commands: test, create-filter, list-filters, process, analyze
       - Validated connectivity and basic analysis functionality
    2. **Performance Metrics** (P2): Comprehensive performance tracking system
       - Commands: dashboard, metrics, export
       - Shows agent counts, event rates, queue status
    3. **Documentation**: Updated PRD and README with new features and accurate completion status

    ### Validation Evidence
    - Ollama integration test passes successfully
    - Performance dashboard displays correct metrics (16 agents, 2 events)
    - All test suites passing: smoke, integration, and unit
    - Health checks responding in <1 second
    - Web UI accessible at http://localhost:4111

    ### Next Priority Improvements
    1. **Multi-tenant Support** (P2) - Isolated workflow spaces for different users
    2. **Native API Endpoints** - Direct API access without Rails runner
    3. **Enhanced AI Filtering** - More sophisticated analysis prompts
    4. **Performance Trends** - Historical performance analysis

    ### Lessons Learned
    - Rails runner escaping requires careful handling of quotes
    - MySQL compatibility requires different queries than PostgreSQL
    - Simple metrics collection is more reliable than complex queries
    - Ollama integration enables powerful event analysis capabilities
