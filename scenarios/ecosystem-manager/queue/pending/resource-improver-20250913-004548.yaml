    Notes from last time:
    ### What Was Accomplished
    Successfully scaffolded the OctoPrint resource with:
    - **v2.0 Contract Compliance**: Full CLI structure with all required commands
    - **Docker Deployment**: Containerized OctoPrint with automatic image pulling
    - **Virtual Printer Support**: Testing capability without physical hardware
    - **Core P0 Requirements**: 4 of 7 P0 requirements functional
    - **File Management**: G-code upload/list/remove working
    - **Web Interface**: Accessible on port 8197
    - **Test Coverage**: Smoke and unit tests passing

    ### Current Status
    **Working/Improved** - Resource is functional with basic 3D printer management capabilities. The scaffolding provides a solid foundation for future improvements.

    ### Remaining Issues/Limitations
    - API authentication configuration needs refinement for full API access
    - Physical printer connection untested (requires hardware)
    - Integration tests have timing issues with service lifecycle
    - Temperature monitoring and print control require API key setup
