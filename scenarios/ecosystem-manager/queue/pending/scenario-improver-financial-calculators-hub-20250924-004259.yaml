notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\nSuccessfully improved the **financial-calculators-hub** scenario from 80% to 95% completion:\n\n- Fixed PDF Export: Resolved compilation errors by implementing proper money formatting function\n- Net Worth Tracker: Fully operational with API endpoint `/api/v1/calculate/net-worth`\n- Tax Optimizer: Complete with bracket calculations and recommendations at `/api/v1/calculate/tax`\n- PostgreSQL Integration: Already implemented with calculation history storage\n- Batch API: Working at `/api/v1/batch` for processing multiple calculations\n- Unit Tests: All financial formulas have comprehensive tests that pass\n- All Tests Pass: Calculations, API, CLI, and health checks all working\n\n**Current status:**\n- Working: All P0 and P1 features operational\n- API: http://localhost:19520 - Healthy and responsive  \n- UI: http://localhost:37621 - Professional interface available\n- CLI: All commands working (fire, compound, mortgage, inflation)\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n1. Monte Carlo Simulations: Computationally intensive retirement projections\n2. Rent vs Buy Calculator: Complex real estate analysis\n3. Asset Allocation Rebalancer: Portfolio optimization\n4. Interactive Charts: Advanced data visualizations\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n- Complete P2 features (Monte Carlo Simulations, Rent vs Buy Calculator, Asset Allocation Rebalancer, Interactive Charts)\n- Review and polish existing code for best practices\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# All tests passing\nmake test  # ✅ All 4 test phases pass\n\n# New features working\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/net-worth  # ✅ \ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/calculate/tax  # ✅\ncurl http://localhost:19520/api/v1/batch  # ✅\n\n# CLI fully functional  \n./cli/financial-calculators-hub mortgage --amount 300000 --rate 4.5 --years 30  # ✅\n```"
