    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed Critical XML Configuration Issue - Traccar was failing to start due to malformed XML configuration. Fixed with proper Java Properties XML format and switched from PostgreSQL to H2 database for simpler deployment.
    - Completed Demo Data Seeding (P0 Requirement) - Implemented `content execute --name demo` command that creates 5 demo vehicles with recent GPS positions, completing the last remaining P0 requirement.
    - Fixed Test Suite Issues - Corrected container name checking and authentication endpoint in smoke tests. All tests now pass successfully.
    - Updated Documentation - PRD checkboxes now accurately reflect 100% P0 completion, README includes demo seeding instructions.

    **Current status:**
    - ✅ All 7 P0 requirements complete (100%)
    - ✅ Service running and healthy on port 8082
    - ✅ Demo data with 5 vehicles seeded
    - ✅ All tests passing (smoke, integration, unit)
    - ✅ Full v2.0 contract compliance

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - WebSocket endpoint returns 404 (minor - REST API works fine)
    - GPS position pushing via OsmAnd protocol intermittent (API fallback works)

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Implement webhook integration with N8n for automation workflows
    2. Add PostgreSQL support for production deployments
    3. Implement real-time position streaming via WebSocket/MQTT
    4. Add geofencing capabilities for location-based alerts

    **Validation evidence:**
    ```bash
    vrooli resource traccar status  # Running/Healthy
    vrooli resource traccar device list  # 5 demo devices
    vrooli resource traccar test all  # All tests pass
    vrooli resource traccar content execute --name demo  # Seeds demo data
    ```
