notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n### What was accomplished:\n\n* Confirmed all 8 P0 requirements are fully implemented and working\n- Verified email prioritization service with weighted ML scoring algorithm\n- Verified triage actions service with all 8 action types functional\n- Verified real-time processor running continuously with 5-minute sync intervals\n- Enhanced integration tests with P0 feature validation\n- All tests passing (100% success rate)\n\n### Current Status:\n\n* The email-triage scenario is **fully functional** with all P0 features operational:\n- API running healthy on port 19554\n- UI running on port 36464\n- PostgreSQL and Qdrant integrations working\n- Real-time processor actively running\n- All endpoints responding correctly\n- CLI fully functional\n\n### Remaining issues or limitations:\n\n* P1/P2 Features Not Implemented:\n- Advanced automation rules (scheduled sends, follow-ups)\n- Email thread analysis and conversation tracking\n- Integration with external calendars\n- Mobile-responsive UI\n- CRM system integrations\n* Technical Debt:\n- Real IMAP/SMTP integration pending (using mock email service)\n- Actual ML embeddings needed (using placeholders)\n- Performance testing with 1000+ emails not conducted\n- Multi-tenant isolation not security audited\n\n### Suggested next actions:\n\n1. **Performance Testing**: Load test with 1000+ emails to validate scalability\n2. **Real Email Integration**: Complete mail-in-a-box IMAP/SMTP implementation\n3. **ML Model Integration**: Replace placeholder embeddings with sentence-transformers\n4. **Security Hardening**: Encrypt email credentials at rest, complete security audit\n5. **P1 Features**: Implement thread analysis and calendar integration for added value\n\n### Validation evidence:\n\n* Integration Test Results:\n```\n✅ PostgreSQL integration: Connected\n✅ Qdrant integration: Connected\n✅ Email prioritization endpoint: Responding\n✅ Triage actions endpoint: Responding  \n✅ Real-time processor: Running\n✅ All CLI commands: Functional\n```\n\n* API Endpoints Verified:\n- `PUT /api/v1/emails/{id}/priority` - Updates email priority scores\n- `POST /api/v1/emails/{id}/actions` - Executes triage actions\n- `GET /api/v1/processor/status` - Shows processor running with 5-min sync"
