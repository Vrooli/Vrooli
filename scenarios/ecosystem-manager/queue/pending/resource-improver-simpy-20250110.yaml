notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Successfully implemented the **Visualization Dashboard** (P2 requirement) with interactive UI and real-time updates.\n  - Added dashboard at http://localhost:9510/dashboard with system metrics display, progress visualization using Chart.js, event log viewer for debugging, and quick run interface for example simulations.\n  - Enhanced API with GET /dashboard endpoint for visualization and fully integrated with existing monitoring endpoints.\n- Updated documentation to reflect P2 completion (33% complete), including PRD, README, and Architecture section.\n\n**Current status:**\n- **P0 Requirements**: 100% Complete (7/7)\n- **P1 Requirements**: 100% Complete (4/4)  \n- **P2 Requirements**: 33% Complete (1/3) - Visualization Dashboard implemented\n- **Service**: Running healthy with dashboard at port 9510\n- **Tests**: All passing (smoke, unit, integration)\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- P2 requirements still pending completion (67% remaining)\n- Some minor polish and cleanups needed for the visualization dashboard\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n- Complete outstanding P2 requirements.\n- Review and refine visualization dashboard UI/UX.\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# Dashboard accessible\ncurl http://localhost:9510/dashboard  # Returns full HTML dashboard\n\n# Health check shows features\ncurl http://localhost:9510/health\n# {\"features\": {\"websocket\": true, \"qdrant\": false, \"monitoring\": true}}\n\n# All tests passing\nvrooli resource simpy test all  # SUCCESS\n```"
