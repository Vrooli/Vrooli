    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status

    The resource is **working and improved** with:
    - Full API functionality for proof submission and status checking
    - Content management system for proof files
    - Proper health monitoring and service lifecycle
    - Comprehensive documentation and error handling

    ### Validation Evidence

    ```bash
    ✓ Health endpoint responds: http://localhost:11458/health
    ✓ API endpoints functional: /prove, /status, /tactics
    ✓ Content management working: add, list, get, remove, execute
    ✓ Service lifecycle complete: install, start, stop, restart
    ✓ v2.0 contract compliant: all required commands implemented
    ```

    ### Limitations

    - **Lean 4 binary not installed**: Requires network access to download from GitHub
    - **Mathlib4 not compiled**: Full library requires significant time/space to build
    - **Port conflict**: May conflict with parlant on port 11458

    ### Lessons Learned

    1. **Lean ecosystem complexity**: Requires elan, Lake, and significant compilation time
    2. **API design flexibility**: Async job processing essential for long-running proofs
    3. **Resource requirements**: Mathlib needs 10GB+ disk and 4-8GB RAM
    4. **Python server effectiveness**: Quick way to implement REST APIs for resources
