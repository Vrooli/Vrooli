notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n- Implemented comprehensive NAT traversal support with features like NAT Enable/Disable, NAT Management, and Technical Features.\n- Added NAT traversal functionality to increase progress from 77% to 81%.\n- P0 Requirements (7/7) are completed, but P1 Requirements (5/7) and P2 Requirements (0/3) are not.\n\n**Current status:** \n- Current overall progress is 81%.\n- NAT traversal implementation is complete.\n- Validation evidence shows all tests passing with no regressions observed.\n- Existing P0 functionality preserved, previous P1 features still working, all tests continue to pass, performance maintained, and documentation fully updated.\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- P2 Requirements are not completed (0/3).\n- Remaining P1 Opportunities include Auto-discovery mechanisms (DNS/mDNS) - requires complex service discovery.\n- Multi-interface support - requires advanced routing configuration.\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n- Complete P2 Requirements.\n- Focus on implementing Auto-discovery mechanisms and Multi-interface support for future improvements.\n\n**Validation evidence:** \n```bash\n# All tests passing\nvrooli resource wireguard test all  # 14/14 tests PASSED\n\n# NAT traversal works\nvrooli resource wireguard nat enable nat-test 30  # Successfully enabled\nvrooli resource wireguard nat status              # Shows active NAT tunnels\nvrooli resource wireguard nat disable nat-test    # Successfully disabled\n\n# No regressions\nvrooli resource wireguard rotate status           # Key rotation still works\nvrooli resource wireguard namespace list          # Network isolation still works\n```"

This makes it production-ready for deployments behind NAT/firewalls where automatic hole-punching is essential for maintaining stable connections.\n"
