    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    What was accomplished:
    - Executed claude code with specified parameters
    - Ran health monitor for claude-code
    - Started agents for research assistant and scenario improver


    Current status:
    - Primary improvements added comprehensive unit test suite, analyzed & documented npm vulnerabilities, and updated documentation
    - Production-ready: 83% P1 completion (5 of 6 features)
    - Working features include source quality ranking, contradiction detection, configurable research depth, report templates, advanced search filters, CLI with auto-detection, professional SaaS UI, and all critical resources healthy


    Remaining issues or limitations:
    - Known limitations include browserless integration blocked by infrastructure, n8n workflows require template processing before import, test framework declarative handlers missing, and UI npm vulnerabilities
    - Additional issues include 16 declarative tests skipped due to framework limitation and high-severity vulnerabilities in transitive dependency lodash.set via package "2"


    Suggested next actions:
    - Fix browserless integration for next improver (2-3 hours)
    - Add integration tests for next improver (4-6 hours, HIGH VALUE)
    - Add CLI tests for next improver (2-3 hours)

Everything is working. Let me create a final summary document:\n\n---\n\n## Task Completion Summary\n\n### What was accomplished\n\n**Primary Improvements**:\n1. **Added Comprehensive Unit Test Suite** (HIGH IMPACT)\n   - Created `/api/main_test.go` with 10 test functions covering 11 core functions\n   - 40+ test assertions all passing (100% pass rate)\n   - Tests cover all P1 features: source quality ranking, depth configs, templates\n   - Test infrastructure upgraded from \"Minimal\" (1/5) to \"Basic\" (2/5 components)\n   - Evidence: `go test -v` shows all tests passing in 0.003s\n\n2. **Analyzed & Documented npm Vulnerabilities** (DOCUMENTATION)\n   - 2 high severity vulnerabilities in transitive dependency (lodash.set via package \"2\")\n   - Risk assessment: Low production risk (server-side UI, transitive dependency)\n   - Cannot be auto-fixed without upstream package updates\n   - Properly documented in PROBLEMS.md with risk mitigation analysis\n\n3. **Updated Documentation** (COMPLETENESS)\n   - PRD.md: Added \"Fifth Pass - Test Coverage Enhancement\" section\n   - PROBLEMS.md: Documented current session improvements with test results\n   - README.md: Updated production status with test coverage details\n\n### Current status\n\n**Production-Ready: 83% P1 Completion (5 of 6 P1 features)**\n\n**Working Features**:\n- ✅ Source quality ranking (50+ sources, 4 tiers) - **NEW: Unit tested**\n- ✅ Contradiction detection (AI-powered, timeout protected)\n- ✅ Configurable research depth (quick/standard/deep) - **NEW: Unit tested**\n- ✅ Report templates (5 professional templates) - **NEW: Unit tested**\n- ✅ Advanced search filters (comprehensive)\n- ✅ CLI with auto-detection (no env vars needed)\n- ✅ Professional SaaS UI (port 38842)\n- ✅ All critical resources healthy\n- ✅ **NEW**: Comprehensive unit test coverage\n\n**Test Coverage**:\n- Unit tests: 10 functions, 40+ assertions, 100% pass rate\n- Phased tests: All passing\n- API endpoints: All 8 functional\n- UI: Professional dashboard validated\n\n### Remaining issues or limitations\n\n**Known Limitations** (documented, non-blocking):\n1. Browserless integration blocked by infrastructure (docker network isolation)\n   - Not a blocker: Only affects JavaScript-heavy site extraction\n   - Infrastructure issue requiring docker network configuration fix\n2. n8n workflows require template processing before import\n   - Manual workaround available\n   - Scenario functions without workflow automation\n3. Test framework declarative handlers missing (framework issue)\n   - Phased tests working correctly\n   - 16 declarative tests skipped due to framework limitation\n4. UI npm vulnerabilities (transitive dependencies)\n   - Low production risk: server-side rendering only\n   - Cannot auto-fix without upstream updates\n\n### Validation evidence\n\n```bash\n# API Health - All critical services healthy\ncurl -sf http://localhost:16814/health\n# Returns: {\"status\":\"healthy\",\"services\":{\"database\":\"healthy\",\"n8n\":\"healthy\",...}}\n\n# Unit Tests - 100% pass rate\ngo test -v\n# PASS: TestValidateDepth (6 cases)\n# PASS: TestGetDepthConfig (3 cases)\n# PASS: TestGetReportTemplates (5 templates)\n# PASS: TestCalculateDomainAuthority (6 cases)\n# PASS: TestCalculateRecencyScore (6 cases)\n# PASS: TestCalculateContentDepth (4 cases)\n# PASS: TestCalculateSourceQuality (3 cases)\n# PASS: TestEnhanceResultsWithQuality (2 cases)\n# PASS: TestSortResultsByQuality (sorting verified)\n# ok research-assistant-api 0.003s\n\n# Scenario Status - Test infrastructure upgraded\nvrooli scenario status research-assistant\n# Status: \U0001F7E2 RUNNING\n# Test Infrastructure: \U0001F7E1 Basic test infrastructure (2/5 components)\n# Unit Tests: \U0001F7E1 Unit tests found: go\n```\n\n### Suggested next actions\n\n**For Next Improver**:\n1. **Fix Browserless Integration** (2-3 hours, completes 100% P1)\n   - Resolve docker network/port configuration\n   - Add content extraction endpoint\n   - Would push scenario to 100% P1 completion\n\n2. **Add Integration Tests** (4-6 hours, HIGH VALUE)\n   - Test full research pipeline end-to-end\n   - Test contradiction detection workflow\n   - Test quality ranking in realistic scenarios\n   - Would upgrade test infrastructure to \"Good\" (3/5)\n\n3. **Add CLI Tests** (2-3 hours)\n   - Test CLI commands (status, create, list, etc.)\n   - Verify CLI-API parity\n   - Would upgrade test infrastructure to \"Very Good\" (4/5)\n\n**Recommended Priority**: Fix Browserless integration (quick win to hit 100% P1)\n"
