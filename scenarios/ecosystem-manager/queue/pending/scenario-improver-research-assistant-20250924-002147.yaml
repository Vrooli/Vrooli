notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Fixed API Startup Issues \n  - Modified `api/main.go` to handle missing environment variables gracefully\n  - Added dynamic resource port detection with proper defaults\n  - API now starts successfully and connects to all available resources\n- Resolved Resource Connectivity \n  - Fixed SearXNG port configuration (corrected from 8080 to 8280)\n  - Made Windmill optional so its absence doesn't block functionality\n  - Health endpoint now shows 5/6 resources as healthy\n- Enhanced CLI Functionality \n  - Updated CLI to detect API port dynamically instead of hardcoding 8080\n  - CLI status command now works correctly with running instances\n  - Help command displays comprehensive usage information\n- Database Initialization \n  - Successfully initialized PostgreSQL schema for research_assistant\n  - Reports and other tables created and functional\n  - API can now query and store research data\n\n**Current status:**\n- Working/Improved - The scenario is now functional with:\n  - API running on port 16818 with healthy status\n  - UI accessible on port 38861\n  - CLI commands operational\n  - Database schema initialized\n  - 5 of 6 required resources connected (SearXNG fixed)\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n1. n8n workflows \n- Failed to populate during setup (resource may need restart)\n2. Windmill \n- Resource unavailable (optional, not blocking core functionality)\n3. Integration test script \n- References missing var.sh file (non-critical)\n4. P2 features \n- Multi-language, custom prioritization, collaboration features not implemented\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n- Resolve n8n workflows issue by restarting resource or resolving setup dependency\n- Implement Windmill if necessary for full functionality\n- Update integration test script to reference correct var.sh file\n- Prioritize and implement P2 features (multi-language, custom prioritization, collaboration)\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# API Health Check\ncurl http://localhost:16818/health\n# Result: {\"status\":\"healthy\",\"services\":{\"database\":\"healthy\",\"n8n\":\"healthy\",\"ollama\":\"healthy\",\"qdrant\":\"healthy\",\"searxng\":\"healthy\"}}\n\n# CLI Status\nAPI_PORT=16818 research-assistant status  \n# Result: Shows healthy API with correct service endpoints\n\n# Database\n# Schema initialized with research_assistant tables\n```"
