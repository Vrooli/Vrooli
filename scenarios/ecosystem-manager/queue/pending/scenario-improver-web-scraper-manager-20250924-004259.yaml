notes: "Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n- Executed Claude Code with automation-friendly settings due to non-TTY environment.\n- Ran command 'timeout 5280 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions'.\n\n\n**Current status:**\n- Task reached maximum turns (80) and failed with an error message indicating this condition.\n\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** \n- Permission checks are disabled due to a warning in the execution output.\n- The task does not appear to have completed successfully, as it hit the max turns limit and stopped running.\n\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n- Re-run the task with adjusted parameters to see if the completion threshold can be extended.\n- Verify that the task was designed to handle reaching max turns as an expected failure condition.\n\n\n**Validation evidence:** None reported"
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
