notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    - What was accomplished:
    - Started health monitor for claude-code (PID: 4042921, interval: 30s)
    - Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings
    - Running Claude Code
    - Current status:
    - Permission checks are disabled!
    - Remaining issues or limitations:
    - Permission checks should be enabled to ensure security and compliance.
    - Suggested next actions:
    - Enable permission checks to prevent potential risks.
    - Validation evidence: None reported
