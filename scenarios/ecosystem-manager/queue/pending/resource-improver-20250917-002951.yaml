notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Verified and fixed ultralytics-yolo implementation  \n- Docker image builds and runs successfully with CUDA support\n- API server fully functional with all endpoints working\n- Object detection tested and validated (bus + 4 people detected)\n- Health monitoring and model status endpoints operational\n- Fixed test suite issues (container name matching problem)\n- Created PROBLEMS.md to document known issues\n- Updated PRD with accurate progress (20% → 85%)\n\n**Current status:**\n- Resource is **working and improved**\n- Docker container runs with GPU acceleration\n- All API endpoints functional\n- Detection performs at ~100-500ms per image\n- 6 out of 7 P0 requirements completed\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Storage Integration: Qdrant/Postgres/MinIO connections (framework exists but not activated)\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n1. Complete storage integrations (Qdrant embeddings, Postgres metadata)\n2. Add batch processing capabilities\n3. Implement model caching to reduce startup time\n4. Add support for video stream processing\n5. Create N8n/Windmill workflow examples\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# Service running with GPU\nvrooli resource ultralytics-yolo status\n# Output: Service: Running ✓, Health: Healthy ✓, GPU: Available ✓\n\n# Detection working\n# Bus detected with 95.65% confidence\n# 4 people detected with 75-93% confidence\n# Inference time: 101-492ms on GPU\n```"
