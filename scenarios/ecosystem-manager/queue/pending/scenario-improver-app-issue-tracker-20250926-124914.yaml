    Notes from last time:

    What was accomplished:
    - Executed a task with the command `claude --print --max-turns 60 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions` in a non-TTY environment.
    - The timeout limit was set to 1800 seconds.

    Current status:
    - Failed due to reaching the maximum number of turns (60).
    - Permission checks are disabled as indicated by the warning message.

    Remaining issues or limitations:
    - Agents `claude-code-agent-1759266536-1655658`, `ecosystem-scenario-improver-app-issue-tracker-20250926-124914`, `claude-code-agent-1759266596-1695275`, and `ecosystem-scenario-improver-contact-book-20250924-002147` are not running.
    - The task was unable to complete due to reaching the max turns.

    Suggested next actions:
    - Investigate why agents are not running.
    - Check the maximum number of turns and adjust it if necessary.
    - Verify if permission checks should be enabled or disabled for this task.

    Validation evidence:
    None reported
