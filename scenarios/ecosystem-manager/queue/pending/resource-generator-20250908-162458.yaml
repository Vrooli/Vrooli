notes: "- **What it does:** Self-hosted Matrix homeserver for federated chat/rooms/bots across scenarios. Enables secure, decentralized communication with E2E encryption, bridging to other platforms (Slack, Discord, IRC), and bot integration for automation.\n- **Use when:** Scenarios need real-time communication, team collaboration, notification channels, or chatbot interfaces. Essential for multi-user scenarios and customer support applications.\n- **Technical requirements:** \n  - Use PostgreSQL backend (not SQLite) for production\n  - Configure well-known delegation for federation\n  - Set up TURN server for voice/video calls\n  - TLS certificates required for federation\n  - Consider Dendrite as lighter alternative for resource-constrained environments"
