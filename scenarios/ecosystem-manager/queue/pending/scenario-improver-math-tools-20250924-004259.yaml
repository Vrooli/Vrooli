notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Implemented Newton-Raphson numerical solver with convergence tracking\n- Built gradient descent optimizer with bounds, sensitivity analysis\n- Added linear trend, exponential smoothing, and moving average methods with confidence intervals \n- Implemented derivatives, integrals, partial derivatives, and double integrals\n- Documented all improvements with completion dates in the PRD\n- Created PROBLEMS.md with issues addressed and remaining\n\n**Current status:**\n- **Working**: 7/8 P0 requirements completed\n- **API Health**: Operational without database dependency\n- **Endpoints Tested**: All mathematical operations validated and functional\n- **Performance**: Sub-100ms response times for most operations\n\n**Remaining work:**\n- Plotting/visualization (returns metadata only, no actual plots)\n- Database integration for model persistence\n- Symbolic mathematics capabilities\n- Expression parsing for arbitrary functions\n\n**Validation Evidence:**\n```bash\n# Health:  Returns proper status\n# Equation solving: x²-4=0 → [2,-2] \n# Optimization: minimize x²+y² → (0,0)  \n# Forecasting: Linear trend with confidence intervals \n# Derivative: f(x)=x² at x=3 → 6 \n# Integral: ∫₀² x² dx → 2.667 \n```"
