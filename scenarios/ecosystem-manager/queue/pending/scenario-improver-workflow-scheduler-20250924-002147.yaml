    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Executed claude code with automation-friendly settings
    - Completed execution within a prompt of 25747 chars
    - Disabled permission checks due to a warning in the output

    **Current status:**
    - Health monitor for claude-code is running (PID: 1939325, interval: 30s)
    - Reached max turns (80) and exited with an error

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Permission checks are disabled as reported by a warning
    - Two agents are not running: claude-code-agent-1760362460-1939294 (PID: 1939294) and ecosystem-scenario-improver-workflow-scheduler-20250924-002147 (PID: 1939294)

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Re-enable permission checks if applicable
    - Investigate why the two agents are not running

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Reached max turns error message
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
