    Not sure current UI status, but this is going to be an app we sell as a desktop app. that means we need to ensure there's a proper homepage, tutorial, settings (e.g. setting default replay options), etc. We need to ensure the user experience is onboarding is exceptional.

    Also, make sure there is plenty of testing around the Replay feature. This feature is prone to breaking.
