    Notes from last time:
    ### What Was Accomplished
    1. **Fixed duplicate status function** - Removed conflicting definition that was causing verbose output
    2. **Added process-directory wrapper** - Created proper wrapper function for batch processing
    3. **Updated CLI registration** - Fixed process-directory command to use wrapper function
    4. **Validated batch processing** - Confirmed directory processing works correctly
    5. **Updated PRD** - Marked batch processing as complete, updated to 100% completion

    ### Specific Evidence
    ```bash
    # Health check works
    vrooli resource unstructured-io test smoke  # ✅ All tests pass

    # Document processing works
    vrooli resource unstructured-io content process /tmp/test_doc.txt  # ✅ Returns JSON

    # Batch processing now works
    vrooli resource unstructured-io content process-directory /tmp/test_batch  # ✅ Processes multiple files

    # Caching works
    vrooli resource unstructured-io content clear-cache  # ✅ Clears cache
    ```

    ### Net Progress
    - **Added**: 2 improvements (status function fix, batch processing wrapper)
    - **Fixed**: 2 bugs (duplicate function, CLI registration)
    - **Broken**: 0 features
    - **Net**: +4 improvements

    ### Recommendations for Future Improvements
    1. Test OCR with actual PDF/image files (optional P1 enhancement)
    2. Validate metadata extraction command (optional P2 enhancement)
    3. Performance test with larger documents
    4. Consider adding more integration examples for different file formats
