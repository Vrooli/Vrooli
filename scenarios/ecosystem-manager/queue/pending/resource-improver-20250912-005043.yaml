notes: "Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- The unstructured-io resource is production-ready with 100% compliance to PRD and v2.0 contract specifications.\n- All tests (smoke, unit, integration) pass with no issues or failures.\n- Performance metrics show excellent processing time (<2s) for text files and health checks (<1s).\n- Resource usage is very efficient at 1.55% of allocated memory.\n\n**Current status:**\n- The resource is working perfectly with stable uptime since 2025-09-12.\n- No issues or previously identified problems have been resolved.\n- Status: Running healthy at minimal resource usage (0.06% CPU, 63MB/4GB memory).\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** None reported.\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n1. Update Docker Image periodically to leverage newer unstructured-api versions for performance and feature improvements.\n2. Add Monitoring Metrics by implementing processing time and success rate metrics.\n3. Enhance OCR Testing with a comprehensive test suite covering various image formats.\n4. Performance Benchmarking: Test with larger documents (100+ pages) to validate scaling.\n5. Consider adding Markdown and XML output format support."
