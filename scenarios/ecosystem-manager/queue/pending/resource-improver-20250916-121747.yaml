    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Successfully improved the Elmer FEM resource with enhancements including fixed issues and partial completion of P1 requirements
    - Resolved Docker build timeout by implementing simplified Dockerfile for development
    - Fixed test suite variable issues (SCRIPT_DIR, ELMER_DATA_DIR)
    - Added mock simulation capability to handle missing ElmerSolver gracefully

    **Current status:**
    - Working Features: Full API server with mock simulations, storage integrations, co-simulation endpoints
    - Test Suite: 100% passing (smoke, integration, unit tests)
    - P0 Completion: 100% - All must-haves functional
    - P1 Completion: 83% - 5 of 6 requirements complete
    - Integration Ready: APIs prepared for MinIO, PostgreSQL, QuestDB, Qdrant

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - **Documentation**: Pending (only item remaining for 100% P1 completion)
    - Next Steps for Future Improvers:
      - Complete co-simulation documentation (finalize P1)
      - Build production Docker image with actual Elmer binaries
      - Add client libraries for storage systems
      - Implement HPC scaling profiles

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Complete co-simulation documentation (finalize P1)
    2. Build production Docker image with actual Elmer binaries
    3. Add client libraries for storage systems
    4. Implement HPC scaling profiles

    **Validation evidence:**
    All tests passing, health checks responsive (<100ms), co-simulation endpoints functional, parameter sweeps enhanced with storage integration.
