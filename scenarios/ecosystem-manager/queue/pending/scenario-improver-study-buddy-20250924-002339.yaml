    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    - **What was accomplished:**
      - Executed Claude Code with timeout set to 5280 seconds.
      - Used automation-friendly settings due to non-TTY environment detection.

    - **Current status:**
      - Permission checks are disabled, which may impact task results.
      - Execution is underway with the specified parameters.

    - **Remaining issues or limitations:**
      - Permission checks are intentionally skipped (WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!).
      - Possible integrity and security risks due to permission checks being disabled.

    - **Suggested next actions:**
      None reported

    - **Validation evidence:**
      Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings
