    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Successfully validated and improved the Splink resource, which was claimed to be 100% complete but had several critical issues:
      - Fixed Critical Bugs:
        - Redis connection error loop that spammed logs continuously
        - Corrected Redis port configuration (6380 instead of 6379)
        - Added proper timeout and error handling for stream processing
        - Made stream processing work gracefully without Redis
      - Fixed Test Suite:
        - Corrected container name check in smoke tests
        - Tests now properly validate the resource status
      - Verified All Requirements:
        - ✅ All P0 requirements (health check, deduplication, linkage, DuckDB, unsupervised learning, CLI)
        - ✅ All P1 requirements (Spark integration, visualization, batch processing, PostgreSQL)
        - ✅ All P2 requirements (stream processing, custom blocking rules)
      - Documentation Updates:
        - Updated PRD with production hardening notes
        - Created comprehensive PROBLEMS.md with troubleshooting guide
        - Documented known limitations and future improvements

    **Current status:**
    Working and Improved: The Splink resource is now production-ready with:
    - All features functional and tested
    - Critical bugs fixed
    - Graceful error handling
    - Proper documentation

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Stream processing has reduced functionality without Redis (documented)
    - Spark processing requires external cluster for full performance (documented)
    - Memory constraints for very large datasets with DuckDB (documented)

    **Suggested next actions:** None

    **Validation evidence:**
    ```bash
    # Health check: ✅ Working
    {"status":"healthy","backend":"duckdb","version":"3.9.14"}

    # Deduplication: ✅ Working
    Successfully creates jobs and processes data

    # Stream processing: ✅ Working (without Redis dependency)
    Successfully creates streams without error loops

    # Blocking rules: ✅ Working
    Templates and strategies accessible

    # Tests: ✅ Passing
    Smoke tests now pass correctly
    ```
