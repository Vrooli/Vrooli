notes: |-
    This scenario is important for ecosystem-manager refactoring phases, as shown in the refactoring.md file. Make sure that the cli commands in that prompt work and provide accurate metrics.

    NOTE: There seems to be (or at least recently was) an error with the scenario-completeness-scoring CLI in this environment specifically. If it doesn't work, please investigate and include an issue report in your final response. When I use it normally in a terminal, it works just fine.
