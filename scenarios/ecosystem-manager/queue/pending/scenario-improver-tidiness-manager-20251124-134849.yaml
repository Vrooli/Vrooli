notes: "**What was accomplished:**\n- Executed: timeout 7500 claude --print --max-turns 100 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions\n- **OT-P0-009**: Global dashboard - Already completed in previous iteration\n- **OT-P0-010**: Scenario detail view - Already completed in previous iteration\n- Fixed critical bug blocking UI→API connectivity\n\n**Current status:**\n- **Validation Evidence**:\n  - ✅ Scenario running with 2 healthy processes\n  - ✅ API port 16821, UI port 35308 \n  - ✅ All health checks passing (API: healthy, UI: healthy + connected to API)\n  - ✅ Requirements: 11/62 (18%) complete\n  - ⚠️ Requirements drift: 1 PRD mismatch detected (auto-sync will fix on next test run)\n- **What Now Works**:\n  - ✅ All 6 test phases passing\n  - ✅ All 3 BAS workflows passing end-to-end with requirement linkage\n  - ✅ UI correctly resolves API port 16821 via /config endpoint\n  - ✅ React Dashboard loads real scenario data from API\n  - ✅ Lighthouse accessibility improved to 95% (from previous 92%)\n- **What Still Fails:**\n  None\n- **Regressions Observed:**\n  None detected\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- ⚠️ Requirements drift: 1 PRD mismatch detected\n- **CLI UI Smoke Bug**: `vrooli scenario ui-smoke tidiness-manager` reports wrong port (ecosystem-manager's 36110 instead of tidiness-manager's 35308) - test passes but port detection needs investigation\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n1. Run `make test` again to trigger auto-sync and resolve 1 PRD status mismatch\n2. Investigate CLI UI Smoke Bug with wrong port detection (outside scenario scope)\n3. Continue P0 implementation in order: visited-tracker integration → Agent API wiring → Auto-campaigns\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- **Quick Validation Loop Results:** (see above)\n- **Tests:** (see above)"
