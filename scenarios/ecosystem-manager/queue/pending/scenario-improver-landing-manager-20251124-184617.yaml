    Note that last time I checked (could be fixed now), generated apps fail to start, with an error like this:
    """
    {
        "message": "Failed to start scenario: exit status 1",
        "output": "\u001b[0;31m[ERROR]   Scenario not found: test-dry\n",
        "success": false
    }
    """
    I think this is because all of our shared scenario lifecycle logic depends on scenarios being at scenarios/<scenario_name>/. The fact that we have a staging area isn't supported. If you know of an elegant way to support this (maybe something like `vrooli scenario start <scenario_name> --path <path>) safely without breaking the default lifecycle behavior, the you hereby have permission to update the shared helper to support it. If it is already  set up, landing-manager is using it properly, it has passing test coverage, and you're overall confident it works, then don't worry about it. But afaik, this is not the case yet.
