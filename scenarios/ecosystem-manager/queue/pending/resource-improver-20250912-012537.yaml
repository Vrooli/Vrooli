    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status

    **Working/Improved**: The resource now has complete v2.0 contract compliance structure:
    - ✅ All required directories and files present
    - ✅ Test infrastructure fully functional
    - ✅ Unit tests passing (19/19)
    - ✅ CLI commands properly structured
    - ✅ Documentation and schemas complete

    ### Evidence of Work

    ```bash
    # Unit tests passing
    vrooli resource mail-in-a-box test unit  # 19/19 tests pass

    # CLI help functional
    vrooli resource mail-in-a-box help      # Shows all commands

    # Test infrastructure working
    vrooli resource mail-in-a-box test smoke # Tests execute properly
    ```

    ### Remaining Limitations

    - Service functionality cannot be fully tested without starting the container
    - Integration tests require a running mail server instance
    - Some P0 requirements need runtime validation

    ### Recommendations for Future Improvements

    1. Start the service and validate all P0 requirements work
    2. Test email sending/receiving functionality
    3. Verify webmail and admin panel accessibility
    4. Add more comprehensive integration tests
    5. Consider adding monitoring and alerting capabilities
