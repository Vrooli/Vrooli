notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Real Model Loading: Implemented actual NSFW.js model loading from CDN instead of only using mock data\n- Local Model Caching: Created model management system with download, cache, and cleanup capabilities  \n- Enhanced CLI Commands: Added `content add`, `content remove`, and improved `content list` for model management\n- Robust Fallback: Service gracefully falls back to mock model when CDN is unreachable\n- Proper Image Processing: Added tensor-based image processing for real classification when model is available\n\n**Current status:**\n- Service Status: Fully functional with enhanced model loading\n- Test Results: All 29 tests passing (100% pass rate)\n- P0 Requirements: 100% complete and maintained\n- No Regressions: All existing functionality preserved\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Pre-packing models with resource for offline-first operation\n- Implementing additional model sources (Safety Checker, Custom CNNs)\n- Adding model versioning and update mechanisms\n- Considering implementing WebAssembly support for browser-side detection\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n1. Pre-package models with the resource for offline-first operation\n2. Implement additional model sources (Safety Checker, Custom CNNs)\n3. Add model versioning and update mechanisms\n4. Consider implementing WebAssembly support for browser-side detection\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Real model loading with CDN and local cache support in server.js\n- Complete model download script in lib/models.sh\n- Enhanced content management commands in lib/core.sh"
