notes: "- **What it does:** Industry-standard distributed event streaming platform for high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable messaging. Acts as a durable, high-speed pipeline between data producers and consumers.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need real-time event streaming, message queuing at scale, log aggregation, or building event-driven microservices. Essential for guaranteed message delivery.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - Java 8+ runtime environment
  - KRaft mode (3.3+) eliminates Zookeeper dependency
  - Native Docker image (apache/kafka)
  - Persistent storage for log segments
  - Network configuration for broker communication"
