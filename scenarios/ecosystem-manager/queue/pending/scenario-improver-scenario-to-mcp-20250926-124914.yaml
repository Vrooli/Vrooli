notes: "Notes from last time:\n\n- **What was accomplished:** \n\t* The Claude code execution reached a maximum of 80 turns before failing.\n\t* Permission checks were intentionally disabled due to non-TTY environment settings.\n\n- **Current status:** \n\t* Task execution failed due to reaching the max turns limit.\n\t* WARNING: Permission checks are disabled, which may impact task security.\n\n- **Remaining issues or limitations:** \n\t* Task requires review of failing condition (max turns reached).\n\t* Consider addressing permission check disabling for improved security.\n\n- **Suggested next actions:** None\n- **Validation evidence:** Error: Reached max turns (80)"
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
