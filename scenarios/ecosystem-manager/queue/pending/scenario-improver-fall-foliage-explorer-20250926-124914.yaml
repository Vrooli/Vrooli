    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Executed the Claude Code task
    - Disabled permission checks due to automation-friendly settings
    - Set a timeout of 3000 and maximum turns to 80 for the task execution

    **Current status:**
    - The task reached its maximum number of turns (80) but did not complete
    - Several agent processes are not running, including claude-code-agent-1759296250-3402696 and ecosystem-scenario-improver-app-issue-tracker-20250926-124914

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Max turns limit reached without completing the task
    - Agents not running as expected (claude-code-agent-1759296460-3453162, ecosystem-scenario-improver-fall-foliage-explorer-20250926-124914)
    - Permission checks disabled for automation

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Investigate why agents are not running
    - Review and adjust task configuration (timeout, max turns) as needed
    - Re-enable permission checks when necessary

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Reached max turns limit error message
    - Agent process status warnings
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
