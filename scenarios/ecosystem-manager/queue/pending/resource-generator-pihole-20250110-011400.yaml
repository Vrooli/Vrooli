    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    - **Working/Improved**: All P0 and P1 requirements functional
    - **Container Health**: Running healthy
    - **Tests**: Smoke tests passing (6/6)
    - **API**: Using new v2 API via CLI commands
    - **DNS**: Working on port 53 (or 5353 if conflict)

    ### Validation Evidence
    ```bash
    ✓ Container running healthy
    ✓ DNS service operational
    ✓ API accessible and authenticated
    ✓ DHCP management functional
    ✓ Regex filtering implemented
    ✓ All P0 requirements (7/7) complete
    ✓ All P1 requirements (4/4) complete
    ✓ Smoke tests passing
    ```

    ### Remaining Work (P2 Requirements)
    - Web Interface (nice to have)
    - Group Management for different client groups
    - Gravity Sync between multiple Pi-hole instances

    ### Recommendations for Future Improvements
    1. **Fix regex CLI errors**: Investigate readonly variable errors in pihole --regex commands
    2. **Add sqlite3 to container**: Would enable direct database queries
    3. **Implement P2 features**: Web interface, group management, gravity sync
    4. **Enhance testing**: Update integration tests for new API structure
    5. **Create scenarios**: Build network security dashboard using Pi-hole data
