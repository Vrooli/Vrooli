notes: "Notes from last time:\n### Validation Results\n✅ **Pi-hole resource is fully functional** with all P0 (7/7) and P1 (4/4) requirements operational\n\n### Testing Evidence\n- All test suites passing: smoke (6/6), integration (7/7), unit (5/5)\n- Container healthy on ports 5353 (DNS) and 8087 (API)\n- DNS resolution working: `google.com` → `142.250.64.110`\n- Ad blocking verified: `doubleclick.net` → `0.0.0.0`\n\n### Current Status\n- **Completion**: 79% overall (11/14 requirements implemented)\n- **P0**: 100% complete (7/7)\n- **P1**: 100% complete (4/4) \n- **P2**: 0% complete (0/3 - web interface, group management, gravity sync)\n\n### Work Performed\n1. Validated resource structure follows v2.0 contract\n2. Verified lifecycle management (restart tested successfully)\n3. Confirmed DNS resolution and ad blocking functionality\n4. Ran complete test suite - all passing\n5. Updated PRD with re-verification dates (2025-09-17)\n\n### Recommendations for Future Improvements\n- Implement P2 features for visual management\n- Add DoH/DoT support for encrypted DNS\n- Create network security scenarios leveraging Pi-hole's DNS analytics\n- Consider sqlite3 integration for direct database queries\n\nThe Pi-hole resource is production-ready and providing comprehensive network ad blocking capabilities as designed."
