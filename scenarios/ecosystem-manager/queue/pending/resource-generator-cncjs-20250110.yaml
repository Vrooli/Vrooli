notes: "- **What it does:** Web-based interface for CNC milling controllers supporting Grbl, Marlin, Smoothieware, and TinyG. Features real-time G-code visualization, macro automation system, and remote access controls for managing CNC machines through any web browser.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need CNC machine control, automated manufacturing workflows, PCB milling, or 3D carving operations. Perfect for makerspaces, prototyping labs, and small-scale production environments.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - Node.js 14+ runtime environment
  - Serial port access for controller communication
  - WebGL for 3D G-code visualization
  - JSON-based configuration (.cncrc)
  - Raspberry Pi or PC deployment options"
