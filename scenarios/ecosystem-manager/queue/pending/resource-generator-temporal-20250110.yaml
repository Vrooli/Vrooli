notes: "- **What it does:** Durable execution platform for building highly reliable distributed applications. Provides state management, automatic retries, and exactly-once execution guarantees for complex, long-running workflows.
- **Use when:** Scenarios require mission-critical workflows, multi-step processes with guaranteed completion, or coordination between multiple services. Superior to n8n for workflows requiring strong consistency.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - Temporal Server (self-hosted)
  - PostgreSQL or Cassandra for persistence
  - Elasticsearch for visibility (optional)
  - SDK support (Go, Java, TypeScript, Python, PHP)
  - Worker processes for workflow execution"
