notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n- Successfully improved the SU2 aerospace CFD and optimization platform resource with 10+ new CLI commands for integration and visualization, scripts for data export, vector search, and visualization, implemented convergence animation and VTK generation, and added comprehensive workflow documentation.\n- Corrected Dockerfile meson build options (was failing with wrong syntax), built and deployed Docker container with SU2 v7.5.1 and MPI support, and verified all services running and health checks passing.\n\n**Current status:**\n- All P0 and P1 requirements fully functional\n- Added complete data integration and visualization capabilities\n- All tests pass (unit, smoke, integration)\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** \n- None reported\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n1. P2: HPC scaling with Slurm/Kubernetes\n2. P2: GPU acceleration support\n3. Direct mesh generation from CAD\n4. Automated adjoint optimization loops\n5. Pre-built Docker images in registry\n\n**Validation evidence:** \n- Health endpoint responding in <500ms: `{\"service\":\"su2\",\"status\":\"healthy\"}`\n- All test suites passing: unit ✓, smoke ✓, integration ✓\n- New CLI commands working: `integrate`, `visualize` subcommands added\n- Docker image built successfully with MPI support\n- PRD updated: 100% P0, 100% P1 requirements complete"
