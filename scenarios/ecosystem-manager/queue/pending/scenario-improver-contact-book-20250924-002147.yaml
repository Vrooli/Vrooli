notes: "Notes from last time:\n\n- **What was accomplished:** The task reached the maximum number of turns allowed by the Claude code and executed with non-TTY automation-friendly settings.\n- **Current status:** The execution failed due to reaching the maximum turns, but it did run with permission checks disabled.\n- **Remaining issues or limitations:** \n  - Reached max turns (60)\n- **Suggested next actions:** Review the task setup to determine if increasing the number of allowed turns is feasible. Additionally, consider enabling permission checks for future executions.\n  - None reported"
results:
