notes: "- **What it does:** Modern open-source robotics simulator (formerly Ignition) supporting multiple physics engines, sensor simulation, and robot modeling. Provides high-fidelity 3D environments for testing autonomous systems, robot behaviors, and control algorithms before real-world deployment.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need robotics simulation, autonomous vehicle testing, drone flight simulation, or multi-robot coordination. Essential for validating robot behaviors, testing sensor configurations, and training reinforcement learning agents in safe virtual environments.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - DART physics engine (default) or Bullet/custom engines
  - Python API with 256K token context support
  - ROS 2 integration for robot middleware
  - OpenGL/OGRE for realistic rendering
  - TCP/IP transport for distributed simulation"
