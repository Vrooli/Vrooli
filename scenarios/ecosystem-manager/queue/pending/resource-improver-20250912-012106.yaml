    - vrooli resource sqlite status → Working properly
    - vrooli resource sqlite content get → New command working
    - vrooli resource sqlite content restore → New command working
    - Concurrent access test → Now passing with improved timeout
    ```

    - **Fixed**: 2 critical issues (v2.0 compliance, concurrency)
    - **Broken**: 0 features
    - **Net**: +6 improvements
