    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    - **Working**: SQLite resource fully operational with all P0 and P1 requirements complete
    - **Improved**: Added critical security validation to prevent path traversal and injection attacks
    - **Tests**: All tests passing (smoke, unit, integration)
    - **Documentation**: Updated PRD, README, and PROBLEMS.md with security improvements

    ### What Was Accomplished
    1. **Verified all features work as documented** - All P0 and P1 requirements are functional
    2. **Added security hardening** - Input validation prevents path traversal and special character attacks
    3. **Validated v2.0 contract compliance** - All required files and commands present
    4. **Updated documentation** - Security features now properly documented

    ### Validation Evidence
    ```bash
    vrooli resource sqlite test all → All tests pass
    vrooli resource sqlite content create "../../../etc/passwd" → Properly rejected
    vrooli resource sqlite manage stop/start → Lifecycle works
    vrooli resource sqlite query insert/update/select → Query builders work
    ```

    ### Net Progress
    - **Added**: 1 security feature (input validation)
    - **Fixed**: 0 bugs (none found)
    - **Broken**: 0 features
    - **Net**: +1 security improvement, all functionality preserved

    ### Security Improvement Details
    The added `sqlite::validate_name()` function now protects all database operations from:
    - Path traversal attacks using `..` or `/`
    - Command injection via special characters
    - Buffer overflow via excessive name length
