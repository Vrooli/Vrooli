notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Enabled replication by default - Added replication configuration to `config/defaults.sh` with sensible defaults:\n  - `SQLITE_REPLICATION_ENABLED=true`\n  - `SQLITE_REPLICATION_SYNC_INTERVAL=300` (5 minutes)\n  - `SQLITE_REPLICATION_MONITOR_ENABLED=false` (auto-monitoring off by default for safety)\n- Updated documentation - Enhanced README and fixed outdated PROBLEMS.md:\n  - Added replication configuration variables to README\n  - Corrected PROBLEMS.md to reflect that encryption is now implemented\n  - Updated runtime.json to include all implemented features\n- Validated all functionality - Comprehensive test suite passes:\n  - All P0 requirements working (100%)\n  - All P1 requirements working (100%)  \n  - P2 requirements 75% complete (replication, encryption, batch operations implemented; only web UI pending)\n\n**Current status:**\n- **Working**: SQLite resource fully operational with all advanced features\n- **Improved**: Replication now enabled by default with production-ready configuration\n- **Tests**: All tests passing (smoke, unit, integration, replication)\n- **Documentation**: Fully updated and consistent across all files\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Web UI not implemented for batch operations\n- P2 requirement completion at 75% (replication, encryption, batch operations)\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\n- Implement web UI for batch operations\n- Complete remaining P2 requirements to reach 100%\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\nvrooli resource sqlite test all  → All tests pass\nvrooli resource sqlite status    → Shows healthy status with 6 databases\nvrooli resource sqlite help      → Shows complete v2.0 contract compliance\n```"
