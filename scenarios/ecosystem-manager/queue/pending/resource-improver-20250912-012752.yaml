notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n- The BTCPay Server resource is now feature-complete with full v2.0 contract compliance, complete payment processing capabilities, comprehensive merchant tools (POS, crowdfunding, payment buttons), Lightning Network support, multi-currency support (BTC, LTC, ETH), and all 14 requirements implemented.\n- Crowdfunding campaign support (P2) has been fully implemented with features like campaign creation, listing, status tracking, closure, contribution recording, and data export.\n- Payment button generator (P2) is also complete with embed code generation, statistics tracking, style options, and bulk creation from CSV.\n\n**Current status:** \n- The resource is now at 100% overall completion, moving up from 83% after implementing new features.\n- All smoke tests pass (5/5), and integration tests are also passing (10/10), with an increase from 8 to 10 due to the addition of new features.\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** \n- None reported.\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n- Finalize documentation by updating any remaining sections.\n- Review and polish the implementation for minor cleanups or optimization.\n\n**Validation evidence:** \n- All smoke tests pass (5/5).\n- Integration tests pass (10/10), with increased coverage due to new features.\n- Crowdfunding commands are functional and tested.\n- Payment button commands are also working as expected."
