    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed port conflicts by changing the WebSocket port from 8100 to 8198 to avoid GeoNode conflict and updated port registry and configuration.
    - Resolved Docker build issues by adding required npm dependencies (sqlite3, ws, express) and correcting server.js and index.html integration.
    - Implemented a custom dashboard with Open MCT interface, configured telemetry providers, and added pre-configured telemetry streams.
    - Created external adapters for MQTT and Traccar telemetry ingestion.

    **Current status:**
    - P0 Requirements: 100% complete
      - Containerized Open MCT with NASA framework
      - Sample telemetry streams (satellite, sensors, metrics)
      - Health check endpoint working
      - WebSocket support on port 8198
      - REST API for telemetry ingestion
      - Basic dashboard with time navigation
      - SQLite historical data storage
      - CLI management commands
      - Smoke tests passing
    - P1 Requirements: 33% complete
      - External data source adapters (MQTT, Traccar)
      - Export workflows to PostgreSQL/Qdrant

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Plugin health monitoring not implemented
    - Custom telemetry types not implemented
    - Alert integration not implemented
    - Authentication not implemented

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Implement plugin health monitoring
    - Develop custom telemetry types
    - Integrate alert system
    - Set up authentication

    **Validation evidence:**
    ```bash
    # Health check working
    curl -sf http://localhost:8099/health
    # {"status":"healthy","timestamp":1758037661060}

    # Telemetry ingestion working
    curl -X POST http://localhost:8099/api/telemetry/test_stream/data \
      -d '{"timestamp": 1700000000000, "value": 42.5}'
    # {"success":true}

    # WebSocket on correct port
    docker ps | grep openmct
    # Shows ports 8099 and 8198 exposed

    # Test results
    vrooli resource openmct test smoke
    # All 5 smoke tests passing
    ```
