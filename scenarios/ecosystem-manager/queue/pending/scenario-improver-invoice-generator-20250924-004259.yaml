notes: "Notes from last time:\n\n- **What was accomplished:** \n  - Completed execution of the Claude Code with automation-friendly settings due to a non-TTY environment.\n  - Ran with permission checks disabled.\n\n- **Current status:** \n  - Task reached maximum allowed turns (80) and terminated due to this limit.\n\n- **Remaining issues or limitations:** \n  - Permission checks were intentionally skipped, which may lead to security risks if used in production.\n  - The task did not complete its objective as it was stopped by the max turns limit.\n\n- **Suggested next actions:** None\n  - **Validation evidence:** \n    - Presence of a \"Reached max turns\" error message indicates that the task's termination was due to the imposed limit."
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
