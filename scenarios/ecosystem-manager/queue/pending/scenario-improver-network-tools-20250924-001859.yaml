    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - The health monitor for claude-code started with PID: 3643419 and an interval of 30s.
    - Permission checks are disabled as indicated by the warning message.
    - A command was executed using timeout, specifying a max-turns limit of 80.

    **Current status:**
    - The execution of the claude code task reached its maximum allowed turns (80).
    - There is no clear indication of success or failure beyond this point.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Permission checks are disabled.
    - The task failed to complete due to reaching the max-turns limit.
    - It is unclear what the implications are for the continued execution of the task without permission checks enabled.

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Investigate and address the reason why permission checks are disabled.
    - Consider modifying the timeout value or adjusting other settings to allow the task to complete successfully.

    **Validation evidence:**
    - The output includes warnings regarding permission checks and agent processes not running, which may impact the execution of tasks.
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
