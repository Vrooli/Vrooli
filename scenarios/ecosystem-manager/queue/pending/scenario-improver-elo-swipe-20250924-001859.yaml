notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Fixed CLI port configuration issue (was hardcoded to 19294, now reads from env)\n- Fixed integration test to properly set environment variables\n- All P0 requirements working and tested\n- UI functional with beautiful gradient design\n✅ **Fixed & Validated Core Functionality:**\n- Implemented CSV/JSON export functionality for rankings\n- Verified progress tracking already functional (shows X of Y comparisons)\n- Confidence scores already implemented and working\n- All integration tests passing (100% success rate)\n- API health checks working\n- CLI commands operational\n- UI screenshot captured showing working interface\n\n**Current status:**\nThe elo-swipe scenario is fully operational with enhanced export capabilities:\n- **API**: Running on dynamic port, all endpoints functional including new export\n- **UI**: Beautiful gradient interface, swipe functionality working  \n- **CLI**: Fixed and operational with all commands\n- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Elo calculations and confidence scores\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Undo/skip functionality during swiping (P1)\n- AI-assisted pre-filtering using ollama.json\n- Ranking visualization (graph/chart view)\n- Import lists from external sources\n- Collaborative ranking\n- Historical preference analytics\n### Remaining Features (P2 - Nice to Have)\n\n**Suggested next actions:**\nNone reported\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# Integration tests: 6/6 passing\n✓ API health check\n✓ List creation  \n✓ Getting comparisons\n✓ Submitting rankings\n✓ Retrieving rankings\n✓ CLI functionality\n\n# Export feature working:\ncurl \"http://localhost:19304/api/v1/lists/{id}/rankings?format=csv\"\n```"
