    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed Test Infrastructure
      - Corrected port configuration to use dynamic ports (API: 17808, UI: 37197)
      - Fixed WebSocket authentication to use query parameter token
      - Added test mode authentication bypass for development/testing without auth service
      - Result: 14/15 tests passing (93% success rate)

    - **Completed P0 Requirements**
      - Verified all 8 P0 requirements are fully implemented (100% complete)
      - Clipboard text synchronization confirmed working with WebSocket broadcast
      - All core functionality operational: file upload, auth bypass, WebSocket, UI, thumbnails

    - **Enhanced Testing Architecture**
      - Migrated to phased testing with smoke/unit/integration phases
      - Test runner properly executes all test phases
      - Tests are more maintainable and organized

    - **Updated Documentation**
      - PRD updated with accurate requirement status (8/8 P0s complete)
      - Added comprehensive implementation notes
      - Documented test improvements and current status

    **Current status:**
    - **Working**: All P0 requirements functional
    - **Test Coverage**: 93% (14/15 tests passing)
    - **Production Ready**: Scenario is fully operational for cross-device sync

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Warning messages regarding permission checks being disabled
    - Some agents not running as expected, resulting in warnings

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Re-enable permission checks and investigate warning messages
    - Investigate why some agents are not running as expected

    **Validation evidence:**
    - API Health: `curl http://localhost:17808/health` returns healthy
    - UI Access: `curl http://localhost:37197/` returns 200
    - Integration Tests: `make test` runs with 14/15 tests passing
    - WebSocket: Connection test passing with auth token
    - Clipboard Sync: Upload and broadcast functionality verified
