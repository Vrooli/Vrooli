notes: '- **What it does:** Python-based physics simulation engine for robotics, reinforcement learning, and multi-physics simulations. Provides forward/inverse dynamics, collision detection, and VR/rendering capabilities. - **Use when:** Scenarios need physics-based simulation, robotics testing, game physics, or reinforcement learning environments. Essential for validating robotic behaviors before real-world deployment. - **Technical requirements:** - Python 3.7+ with NumPy/SciPy stack - OpenGL for visualization - URDF/SDF model loading support - Integration with ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) - Real-time and headless execution modes'
