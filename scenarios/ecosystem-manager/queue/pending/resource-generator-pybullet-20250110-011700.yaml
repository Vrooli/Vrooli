    Likely complete, but may benefit from additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings
    - Executed Claude Code with `timeout 1800 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions`
    - Task completion report shows **VERIFIED - PRODUCTION READY** status
    - Validation summary lists all tests and endpoints as ✅ passed (v2.0 Contract, Lifecycle, Health Check, Test Suite, API, Examples, Port Management, Security)
    - Evidence of functionality includes:
      - Health endpoint: {"status":"healthy","version":"2.4.1"}
      - Port allocation: 11460 from registry
      - All tests: PASSED
      - Examples: pendulum, bouncing_ball, robotic_arm, multi_body_chain
      - API operations: simulation CRUD working
      - P0 requirements: 100% complete (7/7)
    - Key capabilities listed:
      - Bullet physics with rigid body dynamics
      - Python API with full bindings
      - URDF/SDF robot model loading
      - Headless simulation mode
      - Real-time step control (240Hz stable)
      - REST API for remote control
      - Multiple example simulations

    **Current status:** VERIFIED - PRODUCTION READY

    **Remaining issues or limitations:** None reported

    **Suggested next actions:** None

    **Validation evidence:**
    ```bash
    ✓ Health endpoint: {"status":"healthy","version":"2.4.1"}
    ✓ Port allocation: 11460 from registry
    ✓ All tests: PASSED
    ✓ Examples: pendulum, bouncing_ball, robotic_arm, multi_body_chain
    ✓ API operations: simulation CRUD working
    ✓ P0 requirements: 100% complete (7/7)
    ```
