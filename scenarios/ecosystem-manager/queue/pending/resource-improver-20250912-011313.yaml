    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed Workflow Module (P1): Updated to use proper REST API endpoints instead of method APIs, added sample workflow creation
    - Fixed Reporting Module (P1): Corrected API endpoints to use REST API format
    - Implemented Inventory Module (P1): Created complete inventory management with items, stock, warehouses, and purchase orders
    - Implemented Project Management Module (P1): Added full project management with projects, tasks, and timesheet tracking
    - Updated PRD: Progress increased from 57% to 75% with 4 new P1 features completed
    - Updated Documentation: Updated PROBLEMS.md to reflect current status and lessons learned

    **Current status:**
    - Status: Functional with enhanced ERP capabilities
    - P0 Requirements: 100% complete (7/7 features)
    - P1 Requirements: 83% complete (5/6 features)
    - P2 Requirements: 0% complete (0/3 features)
    - Overall Completion: 75% (12/16 features)
    - Tests: All tests pass (100% success rate)

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    1. Multi-tenant support (P1) still needs proper API implementation
    2. E-commerce module (P2) API calls fail
    3. Manufacturing module (P2) API calls fail
    4. Mobile UI configuration (P2) needs implementation
    5. Some complex API queries timeout due to ERPNext's permission system

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Address multi-tenant support and P2 requirements for e-commerce, manufacturing, and mobile UI configuration
    - Resolve timeouts caused by ERPNext's permission system

    **Validation evidence:**
    - All tests pass successfully
    - New inventory and project modules properly integrated
    - Workflow and reporting modules updated with correct REST API usage
    - CLI commands registered and available
