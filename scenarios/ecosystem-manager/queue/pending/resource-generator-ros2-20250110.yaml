notes: "- **What it does:** Robot Operating System 2 - middleware for robotics applications enabling robot control, sensor integration, navigation, and distributed computing across robot components.
- **Use when:** Building robotics scenarios, IoT device orchestration, sensor data processing pipelines, or simulation of physical systems. Enables hardware abstraction and modular robot software.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - DDS-based communication (Fast-DDS or CycloneDX)
  - Supports simulation mode with Gazebo
  - Python and C++ client libraries
  - Real-time capable with proper kernel configuration
  - ROS2 domain isolation for multi-robot setups"
