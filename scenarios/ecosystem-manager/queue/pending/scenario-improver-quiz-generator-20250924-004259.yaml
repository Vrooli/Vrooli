notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Successfully improved from 50% → 87.5% completion of P0 requirements in the quiz-generator scenario\n- Completed UI with 8 pages, including Dashboard, Create, Take, Results, etc.\n- Implemented test infrastructure with smoke and integration tests\n- All 7 smoke tests passing\n- Updated documentation (PRD and README)\n- Proper lifecycle management with dynamic ports\n\n**Current status:**\n- API running on port 16470 with all endpoints functional\n- UI running on port 3251 with complete React interface\n- CLI installed and accessible via `quiz-generator` command\n- Database connected to PostgreSQL with schema initialized\n- Tests comprehensive test suite in `/test/phases/`\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Ollama Integration for AI-powered question generation from documents still incomplete (currently uses fallback questions)\n  - Requires Ollama resource to be running\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n1. Complete Ollama integration for true AI-powered quiz generation\n2. Implement P1 features like difficulty levels and semantic search with Qdrant\n3. Add more robust error handling in the UI\n4. Implement quiz statistics and analytics collection\n5. Add QTI export format support\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# All tests passing:\n✅ Health endpoint test\n✅ Quiz generation test  \n✅ Manual creation test\n✅ Quiz retrieval test\n✅ JSON export test\n✅ CLI availability test\n✅ UI availability test\n```"
