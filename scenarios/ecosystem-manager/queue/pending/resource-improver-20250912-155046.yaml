notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n1. Added Distributed Energy Resources (DER) Support (P1):\n   - Created 4 new DER example models (solar PV, battery, EV charging, microgrid)\n   - Implemented `/der/analyze` endpoint for DER impact analysis\n   - Added `/der/optimize` endpoint for optimal DER placement\n   - Created `/der/demand_response` endpoint for DR program simulation\n\n2. Implemented Market Simulation Capabilities (P1):\n   - Added `/market/simulate` for day-ahead market clearing\n   - Created `/market/transactive` for P2P energy trading simulation\n   - Implemented `/market/ancillary` for ancillary services markets\n   - Added `/market/capacity` for capacity market auctions\n\n3. Created Visualization Dashboard (P2):\n   - Built interactive HTML dashboard with real-time monitoring\n   - Added power flow visualization with Plotly charts\n   - Implemented DER impact analysis visualizations\n   - Created market price forecasting graphs\n   - Dashboard accessible at `/dashboard` endpoint\n\n4. Updated Documentation:\n   - Updated PRD with completed requirements\n   - Enhanced README with new API endpoints and features\n   - Added progress history to track improvements\n\n**Current status:**\n- **P0 Requirements**: 100% complete\n- **P1 Requirements**: 100% complete (all 4 P1 requirements now implemented)\n- **P2 Requirements**: 33% complete (1 of 3 P2 requirements implemented)\n- **Service**: Fully operational with comprehensive smart grid capabilities\n- **API**: Enhanced with 8 new endpoints for DER and market simulation\n- **Tests**: Smoke (100%), Unit (100%), Integration (80% - restart test timing sensitive)\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Co-simulation Support (FMI/FMU standards)\n- Machine Learning Integration (load forecasting and optimization)\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n1. Complete P2 requirements:\n   - Implement co-simulation support\n   - Integrate machine learning for load forecasting and optimization\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Health check responds: ✅\n- DER analysis working: ✅ (tested with solar capacity 200kW)\n- Market simulation functional: ✅ (tested day-ahead market)\n- Dashboard accessible: ✅ (HTTP 200 response)\n- New examples available: ✅ (4 DER models added)"
