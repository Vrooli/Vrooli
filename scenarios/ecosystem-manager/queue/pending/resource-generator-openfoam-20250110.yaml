notes: "- **What it does:** Leading open-source computational fluid dynamics software for complex fluid flow, heat transfer, chemical reactions, and electromagnetics simulation. Features mathematical notation syntax, cloud API integration, and OpenFOAMGPT 2.0 for automated end-to-end CFD workflows.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need fluid dynamics simulation, aerodynamics analysis, heat transfer modeling, or turbulence studies. Essential for engineering design validation, environmental flow modeling, and industrial process optimization.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - C++ core with Python bindings
  - Support for 100M+ cell meshes
  - Spark, AWS Athena, or DuckDB backends
  - MPI for parallel processing
  - ParaView for post-processing visualization"
