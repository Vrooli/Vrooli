    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Fixed PostgreSQL database population issue - now properly seeded with 58 algorithms
    - Fixed benchmark endpoint implementation by adding default input sizes
    - Verified all API endpoints working correctly (health, search, categories, stats, benchmark)
    - Confirmed CLI tests pass 5/5
    - Updated PRD with current status and improvement history

    **Current status:**
    The algorithm-library scenario is functional with 5/6 P0 requirements complete. The Judge0 integration remains blocked due to system cgroup configuration issues, which is a known limitation documented in the PRD.

    **Remaining limitations:**
    - Judge0 code execution hangs due to cgroup configuration issues at the system level
    - 'Execute and validate algorithms' P0 requirement not working

    **Suggested next actions:**
    None reported

    **Validation evidence:**
    - Database: 58 algorithms loaded
    - API: All endpoints responding correctly
    - CLI: 5/5 BATS tests passing
    - Security: 0 vulnerabilities found
