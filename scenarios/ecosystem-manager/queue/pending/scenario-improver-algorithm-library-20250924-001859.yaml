    Notes from last time:

    - **What was accomplished:**
      - The execution of the Claude Code task has made progress, with the command being run in a non-TTY environment and using automation-friendly settings.
    - **Current status:**
      - The task has reached its maximum turns (80) as specified by the --max-turns flag.
    - **Remaining issues or limitations:**
      - Permission checks are disabled due to the --dangerously-skip-permissions flag, which may pose a security risk.
      - The task failed to complete successfully due to reaching the max turns.
    - **Suggested next actions:**
      - Review and modify the task settings to increase the maximum turns or adjust other parameters as needed.
      - Consider re-enabling permission checks for added security.
      - Investigate why the task was unable to continue beyond the max turns, potentially exploring alternative approaches or configurations.

    Validation evidence:
    - The error message clearly indicates that the task has reached its maximum allowed turns.
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
