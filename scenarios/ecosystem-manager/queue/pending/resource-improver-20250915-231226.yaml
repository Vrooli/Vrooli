    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    1. ✅ V2.0 Contract Compliance: Resource structure fully compliant with v2.0 universal contract
    2. ✅ Docker Deployment: Services deploy successfully with MongoDB persistence
    3. ✅ CLI Commands: Comprehensive CLI interface for resource management
    4. ✅ Documentation: Updated PRD with accurate status, created PROBLEMS.md with detailed analysis

    **Current status:**
    - Status: Degraded - Services start but gateway not accessible
    - Key Issue: Eclipse Ditto 3.5.6 requires cluster formation even in standalone mode
    - Impact: API endpoints, WebSocket, and authentication features blocked by gateway issues

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Clustering requirement cannot be bypassed through environment variables alone
    - Version compatibility issue with Eclipse Ditto 3.5.6
    - Official docs may not cover edge cases like single-node deployments

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Try Eclipse Ditto 2.x which may have better standalone support
    2. Deploy 2+ gateway instances to satisfy clustering requirements
    3. Build modified images with clustering disabled
    4. Consider alternative digital twin platforms if standalone is critical

    **Validation evidence:**
    - PRD updated with accurate progress tracking
    - PROBLEMS.md created with comprehensive issue documentation
    - Docker-compose.yml simplified and port conflicts resolved
    - Multiple configuration approaches tested and documented
