notes: "Notes from last time:\n### \U0001F4CA Current Status\n- **P0 Requirements**: 100% Complete (6/6) ✅\n- **P1 Requirements**: 75% Complete (3/4)\n- **Overall Progress**: 69% Complete (9/13 requirements)\n\n### ⚠️ Remaining Limitations\n- **Code Execution**: While workers are properly configured, actual code execution still faces isolate issues due to Docker-in-Docker complexities. The API, batch submission, and analytics features all work correctly.\n\n### \U0001F3AF Specific Evidence\n\nTest commands that validate the improvements:\n```bash\n# Batch submission functionality\nsource /home/matthalloran8/Vrooli/resources/judge0/lib/batch.sh && judge0::batch::benchmark 5\n\n# Analytics dashboard\nsource /home/matthalloran8/Vrooli/resources/judge0/lib/analytics.sh && judge0::analytics::dashboard\n\n# Health check verification\ntimeout 5 curl -sf http://localhost:2358/version | jq\n```\n\n### \U0001F4A1 Recommendations for Future Improvements\n1. **Resolve Isolate Issue** - Consider alternative sandbox solutions or proper isolate setup\n2. **Implement Advanced Security** - Complete P1 requirement for enhanced sandbox validation\n3. **Add Custom Language Support** - Allow dynamic language configuration (P2)\n4. **Create Webhook System** - Implement callback notifications for async processing (P2)\n5. **Build Result Caching** - Cache identical submissions for performance (P2)\n\nThe Judge0 resource now has robust batch processing and analytics capabilities, making it significantly more valuable for processing multiple code submissions and tracking execution patterns over time."
