notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Code Quality Improvements: Fixed 6 shellcheck warnings (SC2155) in `lib/geocoding.sh` and `lib/common.sh` by properly separating variable declarations from assignments\n- Documentation Updates: \n  - Updated README.md with production-ready status\n  - Added recent improvements section to PROBLEMS.md documenting the shellcheck fixes\n  - Updated PRD.md progress history with today's improvements\n- Validation: Verified all features still work after code quality improvements\n\n**Current status:**\n**Working/Improved** - PostGIS remains fully functional with all P0, P1, and P2 features verified working. Code quality has been enhanced through shellcheck compliance fixes.\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** None - The resource is production-ready with 100% PRD completion.\n\n**Suggested next actions:** None\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n```bash\n# Health endpoint working\n{\"status\":\"healthy\",\"service\":\"postgis\",\"version\":\"3.4 USE_GEOS=1 USE_PROJ=1 USE_STATS=1\"}\n\n# Smoke tests passing\n[SUCCESS] PostGIS is running and accessible\n\n# Geocoding functional after fixes\n✅ Geocoded: lat=38.8977, lon=-77.0365 (confidence=1.0)\n\n# v2.0 commands verified available\nhelp, info, manage, test, content, status, logs - all present\n```"

Fixed shellcheck SC2155 warnings by separating declarations from assignments in:\n   - `lib/geocoding.sh`: 4 instances fixed (lines 83, 130, 186, 206, 231)\n   - `lib/common.sh`: 1 instance fixed (line 194)\n2. Updated documentation to reflect production-ready status\n3. Documented improvements in PROBLEMS.md for future reference\n\nThe PostGIS resource maintains its 100% PRD completion with enhanced code quality through proper shell script best practices.\n"
