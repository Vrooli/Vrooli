    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    **Working/Improved** - PostGIS remains fully functional with enhanced import capabilities and better user feedback

    ### Evidence of Improvements

    ```bash
    # Routing initialization now provides feedback
    vrooli resource postgis spatial init-routing
    # Output: ✅ Routing tables initialized successfully
    #   - Created road_network table with spatial indices
    #   - Created road_vertices table
    #   - Tables created: 2
    #   - pgRouting extension: ⚠️  Not available (advanced routing limited)

    # SQL import continues to work perfectly
    vrooli resource postgis content add /tmp/test_cities.sql
    # Output: ✅ SQL file executed successfully

    # New import commands available
    vrooli resource postgis content help | grep import
    # Shows: import-shapefile, import-geojson, import-kml, import-gis

    # All tests passing
    vrooli resource postgis test all
    # Output: ✅ All tests passed!
    ```

    ### Remaining Minor Issues
    - **ogr2ogr not in container**: The PostGIS container doesn't include gdal-bin by default. SQL import works perfectly as the recommended approach.

    ### Recommendations for Future
    1. Consider creating custom PostGIS image with gdal-bin pre-installed if GIS format import becomes critical
    2. Add more spatial analysis examples to documentation
    3. Consider adding support for PostGIS 3D and raster capabilities
