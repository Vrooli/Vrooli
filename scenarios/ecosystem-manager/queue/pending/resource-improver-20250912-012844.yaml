    Notes from last time:
    ### Current Status
    - **Working**: All P0 requirements fully operational
    - **Enhanced**: Certificate listing with PostgreSQL backend integration
    - **Improved**: ACME protocol accessibility with dedicated commands
    - **Tests**: All test suites passing (unit, smoke, integration)
    - **Health**: Service running and healthy

    ### Verification Evidence
    ```
    ✅ ACME directory accessible and responding
    ✅ Certificate statistics showing X.509, ACME, SSH breakdown
    ✅ PostgreSQL backend configured with 24 tables
    ✅ All test suites passing
    ✅ No regressions introduced
    ```

    ### Remaining Opportunities
    - Full CRL/OCSP implementation for certificate revocation
    - HSM/KMS integration for production deployments
    - Web UI for certificate management (P2)
    - Prometheus metrics export (P2)
