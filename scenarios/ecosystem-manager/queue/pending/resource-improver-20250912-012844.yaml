notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - P0 requirements fully operational (100% complete)
    - 80% of P1 requirements completed
    - Certificate revocation system implemented with support for `revoke` command, CRL data generation, and status verification
    - Certificate template management implemented with add/list/remove commands, pre-defined templates, and custom configuration options

    **Current status:**
    - Working on all P0 requirements (100% complete)
    - Made significant progress on P1 requirements (80% complete)

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - HSM/KMS integration requires external hardware/service setup and cannot be completed without access to actual HSM/KMS infrastructure
    - Some P1 requirements remain incomplete (20% outstanding)

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Complete HSM/KMS integration with actual hardware/service setup
    - Finish remaining P1 requirements

    **Validation evidence:**
    - All tests passing (unit, smoke, integration)
    - New commands functional and documented
    - PostgreSQL backend operational with 24 tables
    - No regressions introduced
    - Help text updated with new command groups
