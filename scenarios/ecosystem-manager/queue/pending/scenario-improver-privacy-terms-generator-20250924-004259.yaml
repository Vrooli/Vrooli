notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- Successfully enhanced the privacy-terms-generator scenario with P1 feature implementations for Web Search Integration, PDF Export Functionality, Enhanced UI, and Cookie & EULA Support.\n- Created modules `web_updater.sh` and `pdf_exporter.sh` for web search integration and PDF export functionality, respectively.\n- Implemented template update mechanism with freshness tracking and automatic template generation from web-sourced requirements.\n\n**Current status:**\n- P0 requirements: 100% complete\n- P1 requirements: 60% complete (3 out of 5 implemented)\n- All core functionality working and tested\n- Documentation updated with new features\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- Version history tracking for generated documents not implemented\n- Semantic search for relevant clauses via Qdrant not implemented\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n- Implement version history tracking for generated documents\n- Complete semantic search for relevant clauses via Qdrant\n- Address any issues documented in PROBLEMS.md and PRD\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- CLI generates valid documents: `./cli/privacy-terms-generator generate privacy --business-name \"Test\" --jurisdiction US` ✅\n- Multiple formats supported: markdown, HTML, PDF ✅\n- Web update functionality implemented ✅\n- UI connected to real API ✅\n- Tests passing for core functionality ✅"

The scenario is working well. Let me create a final summary:\n\n## Summary\n\n**What was accomplished:**\nSuccessfully enhanced the privacy-terms-generator scenario with significant P1 feature implementations:\n\n1. **Web Search Integration** ✅\n   - Created `web_updater.sh` module to fetch legal requirements from authoritative sources\n   - Implemented template update mechanism with freshness tracking\n   - Added automatic template generation from web-sourced requirements\n\n2. **PDF Export Functionality** ✅\n   - Created `pdf_exporter.sh` module with HTML conversion and PDF generation\n   - Added multi-format support (Markdown, HTML, PDF) to CLI and API\n   - Integrated format selection into UI\n\n3. **Enhanced UI** ✅\n   - Connected UI to actual API endpoints\n   - Enabled all format options including PDF\n   - Fixed API integration for real document generation\n\n4. **Cookie & EULA Support** ✅\n   - Templates now support all document types (privacy, terms, cookie, EULA)\n   - CLI supports generation of all document types\n\n**Current status:** \n- P0 requirements: 100% complete\n- P1 requirements: 60% complete (3 out of 5 implemented)\n- All core functionality working and tested\n- Documentation updated with new features\n\n**Remaining P1 features not implemented:**\n- Version history tracking for generated documents\n- Semantic search for relevant clauses via Qdrant\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- CLI generates valid documents: `./cli/privacy-terms-generator generate privacy --business-name \"Test\" --jurisdiction US` ✅\n- Multiple formats supported: markdown, HTML, PDF ✅\n- Web update functionality implemented ✅\n- UI connected to real API ✅\n- Tests passing for core functionality ✅\n\n**Issues documented:**\n- Created PROBLEMS.md with Ollama command interface fix and other issues encountered\n- Updated PRD with progress tracking showing P1 60% completion\n- Enhanced README with new usage examples\n\nThe scenario now provides robust legal document generation with web-sourced template updates and multi-format export capabilities, significantly enhancing its value as a reusable Vrooli capability.\n"
