notes: |-
    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - The mcrcon resource has been successfully enhanced with PaperMC integration and real server testing.
    - All features were tested with a real PaperMC server, and all RCON commands work properly.
    - Integration helper commands for auto-configuration were added.

    **Current status:**
    - Permission checks are disabled (WARNING).
    - All tests pass: smoke (7/7), unit (4/4), integration (12/12).
    - Successfully connected to a real PaperMC server.
    - All P0/P1/P2 requirements verified working.
    - Integration commands function correctly.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Permission checks are disabled, which could pose security risks if left unaddressed.
    - There may be documentation tweaks remaining since the completion percentage for PRD.md is not mentioned as being 100%.

    **Suggested next actions:**
    1. Re-enable permission checks to ensure security best practices.
    2. Review and finalize documentation updates.

    **Validation evidence:**
    - All tests pass: smoke (7/7), unit (4/4), integration (12/12).
    - Successfully connected to a real PaperMC server.
    - All P0/P1/P2 requirements verified working.
    - Integration commands function correctly.
