notes: "- **What it does:** UK government-developed Python library for probabilistic record linkage and deduplication at scale. Can link 1M records in under a minute on a laptop, with support for 100M+ record datasets using Spark/Athena/DuckDB backends and unsupervised learning.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need data deduplication, entity resolution, record matching, or identity linking across datasets. Essential for data quality improvement, customer data platforms, and analytical data preparation.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - Python 3.8+ with DuckDB for local processing
  - Spark/Athena backends for large datasets
  - Fellegi-Sunter probabilistic model
  - No training data required (unsupervised)
  - Interactive visualization tools included"
