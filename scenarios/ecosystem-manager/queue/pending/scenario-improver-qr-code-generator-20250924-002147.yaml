    Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:

    - **What was accomplished:**
      - Executed task using `claude` with specified parameters.
      - Ran in non-TTY environment with automation-friendly settings.
      - Passed initial checks.

    - **Current status:**
      - Task reached maximum turns (80) and failed to complete successfully.
      - Output indicates that permission checks are disabled.

    - **Remaining issues or limitations:**
      - Permission checks are disabled, which may impact task integrity.
      - Task was unable to fully complete due to reaching max turns.

    - **Suggested next actions:**
      - Review and adjust task parameters, specifically `--max-turns`.
      - Consider enabling permission checks for improved task reliability.

    - **Validation evidence:**
      - Execution logs show successful startup of health monitor.
      - Task output indicates failure due to reaching maximum turns.
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
