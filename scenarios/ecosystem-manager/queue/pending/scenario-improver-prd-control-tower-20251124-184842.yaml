notes: The ability to edit PRDs from the UI is great. And seeing tabs in the Scenario Control Center for viewing requirements and operational targets is super useful. However, it'd be more useful if we had the ability to manage (add/update/delete/copy/move) requirements and operational targets from these tabs (if not implemented already). This would give me more control  and freedom, as it currently feels limiting to be able to see the data but not modify it
