notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:** \n✅ Added Candlestick Chart Support (P1 Feature)\n  - Implemented full candlestick chart generation for financial data visualization\n  - Added proper validation for open/high/low/close data points\n  - Tested successfully with multiple data points\n✅ Verified All Chart Types Working\n  - Bar, Line, Pie, Scatter, Area charts (P0) \n  - Gantt, Heatmap, Treemap charts (P1)\n  - Candlestick charts (P1 - newly added)\n✅ Fixed Service Configuration\n  - Scenario lifecycle works properly through Makefile commands\n  - API running successfully on port 20300\n  - Health checks pass\n\n**Current status:** \nThe chart-generator scenario is **working and improved** with all P0 requirements complete and major P1 features implemented including:\n- All 9 chart types functioning (8 existing + 1 new candlestick)\n- Professional styling system in place\n- CLI and API interfaces operational\n- PostgreSQL integration configured (schema exists)\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:** \n- Custom style builder with live preview\n- PDF export with vector graphics\n- Chart animation and interactivity\n- Chart composition (multiple charts)\n\n**Suggested next actions:** \n1. Implement PDF Export: Add PDF generation using a Go PDF library\n2. Add Style Builder UI: Create interactive style configuration interface\n3. Performance Optimization: Implement caching with Redis when available\n4. Test Infrastructure: Add unit tests and integration tests in test/ directory\n\n**Validation evidence:** \n```bash\n# API Health:  Healthy\ncurl http://localhost:20300/health \n\n# Candlestick Generation:  Success\ncurl -X POST http://localhost:20300/api/v1/charts/generate \\\n  -d '{\"chart_type\":\"candlestick\",\"data\":[...]}'\n\n# All Chart Types:  Tested\nbar, line, pie, scatter, area, gantt, heatmap, treemap, candlestick\n```"
