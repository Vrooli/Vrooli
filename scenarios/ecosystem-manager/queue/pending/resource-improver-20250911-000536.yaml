    Notes from last time:
    ### What Was Accomplished
    Successfully improved the ffmpeg resource from 58% to 75% completion by implementing all remaining P1 requirements:

    1. **Preset Library** - Added 15 presets across video, audio, and conversion categories
    2. **Stream Processing** - Implemented capture, transcode, and info commands for live streams

    ### Current Status
    - **Working**: Resource fully functional with all P0 and P1 requirements complete
    - **Progress**: 75% overall (100% P0, 100% P1, 0% P2)
    - **Tests**: All tests passing (smoke, integration, unit)

    ### Validation Evidence
    ```bash
    vrooli resource ffmpeg test all      # PASSES
    vrooli resource ffmpeg preset list   # Shows 15 presets
    vrooli resource ffmpeg stream info   # Works with live streams
    ```

    ### Key Improvements
    - Comprehensive preset library for common media conversion tasks
    - Full stream processing capability with capture and transcoding
    - Maintained backward compatibility with all existing features
    - GPU acceleration verified (3.08x speedup with NVENC)
