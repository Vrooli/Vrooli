notes: "- **What it does:** Cross-platform AI engine providing pre-built computer vision models via REST API. Includes object detection (80+ classes), face detection/recognition, scene recognition, and custom model training.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need computer vision without ML expertise - security monitoring, content moderation, automated tagging, accessibility features, or visual automation workflows.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - Docker deployment with CPU or GPU acceleration
  - REST API on configurable port
  - Redis for caching recognition results
  - Custom model support via training API
  - Integration with webcam feeds and image uploads"
