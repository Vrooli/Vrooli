notes: "- **What it does:** Open-source parametric 3D CAD modeler with Python API for programmatic design generation. Supports architectural modeling, mechanical design, and engineering simulations with extensive file format compatibility.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need automated CAD generation, parametric design workflows, or integration between design and manufacturing. Complements existing OpenSCAD for more complex engineering workflows.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - Python 3.7+ with extensive scientific libraries
  - OpenGL for 3D rendering
  - Assembly workbench for multi-part designs
  - FEM workbench for finite element analysis
  - Path workbench for CAM/CNC integration"
