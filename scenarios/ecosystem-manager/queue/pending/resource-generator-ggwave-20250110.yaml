notes: "- **What it does:** Tiny library for air-gapped device communication using FSK-based audio transmission. Supports normal, fast, robust, and ultrasonic modes with 8-500 bytes/sec data rates and Reed-Solomon error correction for reliable data transfer.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need air-gapped communication, secure data transfer without network access, IoT device pairing, or proximity-based authentication. Ideal for secure environments, offline data exchange, and creative communication solutions.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - Standard microphone/speaker hardware
  - 1-5 meter typical range (indoor)
  - MIT licensed with Arduino support
  - iOS, Android, Linux compatibility
  - Ultrasonic mode requires 48kHz sampling"
