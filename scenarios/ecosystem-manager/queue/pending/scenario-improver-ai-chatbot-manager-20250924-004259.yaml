notes: "Already pretty good, but could use some additional validation/tidying. Notes from last time:\n\n**What was accomplished:**\n- **Fixed Critical CLI Issues**: \n  - CLI status --json command now outputs pure JSON without info messages\n  - CLI list command table formatting completely rewritten to work properly\n  - All CLI BATS tests now passing except for minor issues\n\n- **Updated Widget Tests**: \n  - Widget generation test fixed to match actual implementation (external JS file approach)\n  - Tests now check for correct widget.js endpoint and initialization code\n\n- **Verified All P0 Requirements**:\n  - Create and configure multiple chatbots: Working (11 chatbots in database)\n  - Generate embeddable JavaScript widgets: Working (generates proper embed code)\n  - Real-time WebSocket conversations: Working (tested via API)\n  - Conversation storage and retrieval: Working (conversations persisted in PostgreSQL)\n  - Lead capture functionality: Working (lead data stored)\n  - Basic analytics dashboard: Working (UI accessible on port 8537)\n\n- **Updated Documentation**:\n  - PRD updated with current status and known issues\n  - Added progress update section for 2025-09-26\n\n**Current status:** Successfully Improved\n\n**Remaining issues or limitations:**\n- **Performance**: Health check response time is very slow (up to 10 seconds) - needs investigation and optimization\n- **Error Handling**: Invalid chatbot ID returns 500 instead of 404 (minor API issue)\n- **P1 Features Not Implemented**: Event publishing for cross-scenario integration\n- **Load Testing**: Not performed - 1000+ concurrent users requirement needs validation\n\n**Validation evidence:**\n- Health check: Working but slow (returns healthy status)\n- CLI commands: All working with proper JSON/table output\n- Widget generation: Produces valid embed code with external JS\n- Database: 11 chatbots loaded with conversations\n- UI Dashboard: Running on port 8537\n- Test Results: 12/14 API tests passing (86% pass rate)\n\n**Specific improvements made:**\n1. Fixed `ai-chatbot-manager status --json` to output pure JSON\n2. Rewrote `format_table` function in CLI to properly handle stdin\n3. Updated widget test expectations to match external JS approach\n4. Fixed CLI list command table formatting"
