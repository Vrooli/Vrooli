    Notes from last time:

    **What was accomplished:**
    - Started health monitor for claude-code with PID: 122695 and interval: 30s.
    - Executed command: timeout 5280 claude --print --max-turns 80 --allowedTools Read,Write,Edit,Bash,LS,Glob,Grep --dangerously-skip-permissions.

    **Current status:**
    - Permission checks are disabled due to [WARNING] ⚠️ WARNING: Permission checks are disabled!.
    - Agents:
      - claude-code-agent-1759208406-122568 (PID: 122568) is not running.
      - ecosystem-scenario-improver-smart-file-photo-manager-20250924-004259 (PID: 122568) is not running.
      - claude-code-agent-1759208646-380057 (PID: 380057) is not running.
      - ecosystem-scenario-improver-study-buddy-20250924-002339 (PID: 380057) is not running.

    **Remaining issues or limitations:**
    - Reached max turns (80): Error: Reached max turns (80).
    - Non-TTY environment detected and using automation-friendly settings due to [INFO]    Non-TTY environment detected - using automation-friendly settings.

    **Suggested next actions:**
    - Investigate why agents are not running.
    - Address permission checks being disabled.
    - Review logs for further information on reaching max turns.

    **Validation evidence:**
    - No critical tests or TODOs mentioned in the output.
results:
    error: Claude reached the configured MAX_TURNS limit (80). Consider simplifying the task or increasing the limit in Settings.
