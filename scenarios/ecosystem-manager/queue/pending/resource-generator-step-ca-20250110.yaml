notes: "- **What it does:** Open-source private certificate authority for X.509 and SSH certificates with ACME protocol support. Automates certificate lifecycle management with multiple authentication methods, customizable certificate fields, and HSM/KMS integration for secure key storage.
- **Use when:** Scenarios need internal PKI, mutual TLS authentication, automated certificate management, or migration from Active Directory Certificate Services. Essential for zero-trust architectures, microservices authentication, and DevOps certificate automation.
- **Technical requirements:**
  - ACME protocol for automated enrollment/renewal
  - Support for OIDC, cloud APIs, one-time tokens
  - Badger, BoltDB, Postgres, or MySQL backends
  - HSM/KMS support (PKCS#11, AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS)
  - 24-hour default certificate lifetime (configurable)"
