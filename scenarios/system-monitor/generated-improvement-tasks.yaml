  - title: "Implement OpenCode Session Manager with Request Queuing"
    description: "Create a centralized session manager for OpenCode agent calls to prevent rate limiting. Implement request queuing, retry logic with exponential backoff, and distribute requests across multiple API keys. This will prevent the 30-45 minute automation halt issue that occurs when multiple scenarios run concurrently."
