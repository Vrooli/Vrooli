# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

> **Version**: 2.0.0
> **Last Updated**: 2025-11-18
> **Status**: Canonical Specification
> **Scenario**: algorithm-library

## 🎯 Overview

A validated, multi-language algorithm and data structure reference library that serves as the ground truth for correct implementations. This provides agents and humans with trusted, tested algorithm implementations they can reference, validate against, or directly use in their code.

**Primary users**: Software engineers, CS students, coding agents
**Deployment surfaces**: API, CLI, UI visualization dashboard
**Intelligence amplification**: Agents can verify their algorithm implementations against known-correct versions, reduce debugging time with working reference implementations, find similar algorithms for new problems via pattern matching, know when optimization is needed via performance benchmarks, and share a vocabulary of algorithmic patterns across all scenarios.

## 🎯 Operational Targets

## 🧱 Tech Direction Snapshot

- **UI Stack**: React visualization dashboard with interactive algorithm animations
- **API Stack**: Go API server for high-performance algorithm retrieval and validation
- **Data Storage**: PostgreSQL for algorithms, implementations, test cases, and results; optional Redis for caching
- **Execution Integration**: Judge0 resource for secure sandboxed code execution; local executor fallback for Python/JS/Go/Java/C++
- **Integration Strategy**: Shared n8n workflow (algorithm-executor.json) for standardized Judge0 execution; resource CLI for database maintenance; direct WebSocket API for real-time execution monitoring
- **Non-goals**: Algorithm training/generation (reference library only), proprietary algorithms, production code hosting

## 🤝 Dependencies & Launch Plan

**Required resources**:
- PostgreSQL - Store algorithms, metadata, test cases, and results
- Judge0 - Execute and validate algorithm implementations

**Optional resources**:
- Redis - Cache frequently accessed algorithms (fallback: direct PostgreSQL queries)
- Ollama - Generate algorithm explanations (fallback: pre-written static explanations)

**Launch risks**:
- Judge0 unavailable (mitigation: containerized execution fallback)
- Algorithm has bug (mitigation: peer review + extensive test cases)
- Performance regression (mitigation: continuous benchmarking)
- Code injection (mitigation: sandboxed Judge0 execution prevents system access)

**Launch sequence**: Local deployment → Pre-seed 50+ algorithms → Docker Compose → Kubernetes StatefulSet → Cloud deployment (AWS RDS + Lambda)

## 🎨 UX & Branding

**Visual palette**: Dark theme with syntax highlighting; monospace for code, clean sans-serif for UI; split-pane editor with sidebar navigation
**Accessibility commitments**: WCAG AA compliance, keyboard navigation for all features
**Voice/personality**: Technical but approachable, focused and efficient
**Target feeling**: Confidence in correctness - fast, accurate algorithms with clear explanations
**Responsive design**: Desktop priority, tablet supported
