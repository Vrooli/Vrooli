| Date       | Author            | Status Snapshot | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-12-16 | Generator Agent | Initialization complete | Re-scaffolded from `react-vite` template; legacy scenario moved to `/tmp` |
| 2025-12-16 | Codex Agent | OT-P0-001 advanced | Implemented structured health checks (db/git/repo) + unit + CLI integration tests; aligned lifecycle test runner with `test-genie` |
| 2025-12-16 | Codex Agent | OT-P0-002 advanced | Added `/api/v1/repo/status` (branch + file change summary + scope grouping) + unit tests + BAS API workflows + CLI `repo-status` command |
| 2025-12-16 | Claude Agent | OT-P0-003 implemented | Added `/api/v1/repo/diff` endpoint with structured response (hunks, stats, raw output); unit tests (8 new tests); CLI `diff` command with `--path` and `--staged` flags; BAS e2e workflow; requirements updated with multi-layer validation |
| 2025-12-16 | Claude Agent | OT-P0-004 implemented | Added `/api/v1/repo/stage` and `/api/v1/repo/unstage` POST endpoints; support for paths array and scope parameter (scenario/resource/package); path validation and sanitization; unit tests (11 new tests); CLI `stage` and `unstage` commands; requirements split into 3 sub-requirements with multi-layer validation |
| 2025-12-16 | Claude Opus | OT-P2-001 advanced | Built functional Git dashboard UI replacing template: StatusHeader (branch info, health status, file stats, commit OID), FileList (staged/unstaged/untracked files with expand/collapse, individual stage/unstage actions, stage all/unstage all), DiffViewer (structured diff display with line numbers, addition/deletion highlighting, hunk navigation). Added API hooks (useHealth, useRepoStatus, useDiff, useStageFiles, useUnstageFiles), comprehensive test selectors, professional dark terminal-inspired theme per PRD. All 21 API tests + 2 UI tests passing. |
| 2025-12-16 | Claude Opus | Architecture hardening | Created GitRunner seam for testing git operations safely: (1) Moved GitRunner interface and ExecGitRunner to dedicated git_runner.go, (2) Created FakeGitRunner test double for unit tests without real git/filesystem, (3) Refactored HealthChecks to use GitRunner interface (was calling exec.Command directly), (4) Added 20+ new unit tests using FakeGitRunner, (5) Consolidated test helpers into testutil_test.go, (6) Documented seams in docs/SEAMS.md. All 41 API tests passing. Tests now isolate git operations preventing accidental production mutations. |
| 2025-12-16 | Claude Opus 4.5 | Cognitive load reduction | Major architectural improvements: (1) Added ResolveRepoRoot to GitRunner interface - now testable through seam instead of standalone function with direct exec.Command, (2) Created HTTPResponse helper (http_response.go) for consistent JSON responses, (3) Created HTTP handler utilities (http_handler.go) with ParseJSONBody and ValidateStagingRequest, (4) Refactored all handlers to use new response pattern - reduced duplication significantly, (5) Removed dead code: repo_status.go (empty file), unused writeJSONError function, resolveRepoDir standalone function, unused imports, (6) Marked decision boundaries with explicit comments (DECISION BOUNDARY), (7) Updated SEAMS.md documentation. All 41 tests passing, code compiles cleanly. main.go reduced from 347 to 329 lines. |
