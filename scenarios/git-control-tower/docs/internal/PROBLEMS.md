# Problems: git-control-tower

Known issues, tech debt, and deferred work for the git-control-tower scenario.

## Open Issues

### Scenario-level

- The scenario has been re-scaffolded from the `react-vite` template; OT-P0-001
  has initial implementation + tests, but most operational targets remain
  unimplemented.
- Git operations are inherently risky; design must enforce repo-root path
  validation, explicit allowlists, and safe defaults for any mutating endpoint.
- Repository size and file counts can cause slow status/diff calls; plan
  pagination and caching before claiming "production-ready".
- Some `test-genie` phases (smoke/performance) may require a running
  Browserless service; defer those phases until the shared test infrastructure
  is available.
- `vrooli scenario status git-control-tower` currently fails its optional
  `test-genie` structure probe due to an unsupported `-no-record` flag; the
  core scenario test lifecycle still uses `test-genie execute`.

### React stability internals

- ESLint React stability config added with safety-critical rules and import
  cycle detection.
- TypeScript safety rules enforced (strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess) with
  protective comments.
- Guarded array indexing and optional values in App selection logic,
  FileList grouping, GitHistory scopes, file search helpers, mobile search
  selection, and bottom sheet touch handling.
- No remaining lint or type-check failures after `pnpm lint` and
  `pnpm type-check` (2026-02-04).

## Deferred Ideas

- Multi-repo support (path switching, isolation, multi-tenant auth).
- Real-time UI updates (fsnotify + WebSocket channel) once baseline endpoints
  exist.
- **Bulk backfill of `// DOC:` cross-references** across the API/CLI codebase.
  The 2026-05-03 docs audit reported 230 exported symbols missing DOC anchors.
  Out of scope for the current docs-health remediation; high-signal anchors
  added at three sites (api/server.go, cli/domains/domains.go, ui/src/App.tsx)
  as exemplars. Decide later whether to invest in full backfill vs. accept
  partial coverage as the long-term equilibrium.
- **FileList row virtualization** — the 2026-05-03 perf audit added a
  `<Profiler id="FileList">` boundary; if comparison-run data shows
  per-commit cost exceeds ~5 ms or row counts grow into the hundreds,
  virtualize via `@tanstack/react-virtual` (already a dep).
