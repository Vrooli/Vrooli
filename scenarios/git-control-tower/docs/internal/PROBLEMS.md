# Problems: git-control-tower

Known issues, tech debt, and deferred work for the git-control-tower scenario.

## Open Issues

### Scenario-level

- The scenario has been re-scaffolded from the `react-vite` template; OT-P0-001
  has initial implementation + tests, but most operational targets remain
  unimplemented.
- Git operations are inherently risky; design must enforce repo-root path
  validation, explicit allowlists, and safe defaults for any mutating endpoint.
- Repository size and file counts can cause slow status/diff calls; plan
  pagination and caching before claiming "production-ready".
- Some `test-genie` phases (smoke/performance) may require a running
  Browserless service; defer those phases until the shared test infrastructure
  is available.
- `vrooli scenario status git-control-tower` currently fails its optional
  `test-genie` structure probe due to an unsupported `-no-record` flag; the
  core scenario test lifecycle still uses `test-genie execute`.

### React stability internals

- ESLint React stability config added with safety-critical rules and import
  cycle detection.
- TypeScript safety rules enforced (strict + noUncheckedIndexedAccess) with
  protective comments.
- Guarded array indexing and optional values in App selection logic,
  FileList grouping, GitHistory scopes, file search helpers, mobile search
  selection, and bottom sheet touch handling.
- No remaining lint or type-check failures after `pnpm lint` and
  `pnpm type-check` (2026-02-04).

## Worktree Domain Follow-ups (2026-05-16)

The worktree domain shipped Tiers 1 + 2 against the WorktreeService /
RepoService Connect-RPC surface. Deferred from this work and tracked
here:

- **UI worktree feature surface.** The `WorktreeSidebar`, `WorktreeRow`,
  `CreateWorktreeModal` components and the status-header worktree badge
  are not yet implemented. CLI is the agent-facing surface for now. When
  the UI lands, it MUST consume the generated Connect-Web client at
  `packages/proto/gen/typescript/git-control-tower/v1/worktree/` — no
  hand-written interfaces.
- **Branch UI tooltip for claimed worktrees.** `BranchSelector.tsx`
  should disable the switch action and show a tooltip when
  `checked_out_in_worktree` is non-empty. The REST shape already
  carries the field.
- **Audit events for worktree mutations.** `WorktreeCreated`,
  `WorktreeRemoved`, `WorktreeLocked`, `WorktreeUnlocked`,
  `WorktreeMoved`, `WorktreePruned` event types are not yet wired
  through `audit_logger.go`. The Connect handlers should call the
  `Audit` seam on success (and on dry-run with `dry_run=true`).
- **gen-endpoints / EndpointDescriptor parity for new domain.** The
  worktree and repo Connect services are mounted directly in
  `connect_wiring.go` without `Module.Endpoints` / `EndpointDescriptor`
  metadata. Once a second domain adopts the template's module pattern,
  port both domains to `module.Module` + `validateTransport`.
- **Next incremental-migration candidate.** Per
  `feedback_incremental_template_migration`, retrofit one domain at a
  time. **Branch** is the natural next domain (already touched here for
  cross-link). Consider proto-first migration in a subsequent session.
- **Tier 3 worktree features (research candidate).** Agent-session ↔
  worktree mapping; worktree-aware commit composer; cross-worktree
  conflict pre-flight; worktree health overview (stale detection);
  "create worktree from this branch" one-click flow aligned with
  Claude Code's `isolation: "worktree"` integration.

## Deferred Ideas

- Multi-repo support (path switching, isolation, multi-tenant auth).
- Real-time UI updates (fsnotify + WebSocket channel) once baseline endpoints
  exist.
- **Bulk backfill of `// DOC:` cross-references** across the API/CLI codebase.
  The 2026-05-03 docs audit reported 230 exported symbols missing DOC anchors.
  Out of scope for the current docs-health remediation; high-signal anchors
  added at three sites (api/server.go, cli/domains/domains.go, ui/src/App.tsx)
  as exemplars. Decide later whether to invest in full backfill vs. accept
  partial coverage as the long-term equilibrium.
- **FileList row virtualization** — the 2026-05-03 perf audit added a
  `<Profiler id="FileList">` boundary; if comparison-run data shows
  per-commit cost exceeds ~5 ms or row counts grow into the hundreds,
  virtualize via `@tanstack/react-virtual` (already a dep).
