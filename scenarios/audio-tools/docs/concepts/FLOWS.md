## Headline flows

### Transcribe (STT chain)

```
client (consumer scenario)
  └─ Connect-RPC: STTService.Transcribe
       └─ handlers/stt.connectHandler.Transcribe
            └─ extract creds from X-Audio-BYOK-{Provider,Key} + X-Audio-LPBS-Token
                 └─ sttchain.Chain.Execute
                      ├─ enableBYOK && BYOKKey ?
                      │    └─ byok.Adapter[BYOKProvider].Transcribe -> Result (return)
                      ├─ enableVrooli && LPBSToken ?
                      │    └─ lpbs.STTClient.Transcribe -> Result OR ErrInsufficientCredits (short-circuit)
                      └─ enableLocal ?
                           └─ voice.Service.Transcribe -> Result
```

Termination: first success returns. `ErrInsufficientCredits` from Vrooli short-circuits — chain does NOT fall through to Local. `ErrUnknownBYOKProvider` / `ErrMissingBYOKProvider` terminates without fallback.

### Synthesize (TTS chain)

Same shape as Transcribe but per-call resolves canonical voice via the catalog:
```
voice canonical id → voice_overrides["tier:provider-id"] (if any) → adapter mapping → adapter default + warning
```

### Summarize (Summarize chain)

Same chain shape; Local path goes through `tts.Summarizer` (Ollama backend); BYOK path goes through `openrouter` adapter.

### Browser-voice WS session

```
client opens WS /api/v1/voice/stream?voice=…&language=…
  └─ handlers/stt/stream_ws.StreamWSHandler.ServeHTTP
       ├─ session.New(transport="browser-voice", voice, language, CancelHook)
       ├─ session.Registry.Add
       ├─ stt.Segmenter (transport-agnostic streaming pipeline)
       └─ on disconnect: session.Close("ws-disconnect"); registry.Remove
```

Concurrent `SessionService.Subscribe` observers attach to the same `session.Session` and receive every transcript/VAD/barge-in event.

### Barge-in

```
transport VAD reports speech_start during in-flight TTS
  └─ session.BargeIn(BargeInVAD)
       ├─ clear inflight
       ├─ CancelHook(VAD, eventID)  ── transport stops streaming TTS bytes
       └─ EmitEvent(BargeInCancel)  ── observers see the cancel
```

P95 target: ≤ 100 ms from VAD event to observer notification (OT-P0-008).

### Web-console adoption call

```
web-console handler / orchestration
  └─ audioports.RemoteSpeechToText.Transcribe
       └─ integrations/audiotools.Client.STT.Transcribe (Connect-RPC)
            └─ on transport failure: Client.HandleTransportFailure()
                 └─ resolver.Invalidate() → next call re-resolves URL
```

### Usage reporting (Vrooli tier; flag-off today)

```
Chain.Execute completes via Vrooli tier
  └─ integrations/lpbs.Reporter.Submit(UsageReport{OperationID,UserIdentity,Amount,...})
       └─ Reporter goroutine deliver(): 3 attempts at 500ms / 1s / 2s exponential backoff
            └─ POST to LPBS usage endpoint (idempotent by OperationID)
```

This document is the canonical workflow and state-transition map for
the scenario. Use it when behavior depends on ordered states, retries,
cancellation, stale completion, background jobs, polling, or mutually
exclusive UI modes.

## Purpose Of This Document

Use this document to answer:

- Which user/system workflows matter?
- Which workflows have explicit states and events?
- Which transitions are illegal?
- Which tests prove workflow correctness?
- Which flows are known but not modeled yet?

Plain CRUD with no meaningful ordering constraints does not need a
workflow model.

## Flow Inventory

| Flow | Domain | Trigger | Outcome | Statefulness | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Attachment upload | notes | User/CLI uploads a file for a note. | Blob is stored and metadata is persisted. | Stateful upload request with validation and failure paths. | Level 5 workflow tests: matrix, traces, declarative spec, checked Quint model, generated artifacts, and production replay. |

## Flow Details

### Attachment upload

- Owner domain: notes.
- Trigger: multipart upload request from UI or CLI.
- Inputs: note id, file key/name, file bytes, content type, file size.
- Steps:
  1. Parse multipart request.
  2. Validate note id and file metadata.
  3. Store opaque bytes through BlobStore.
  4. Persist attachment metadata through notes repository seam.
  5. Return proto-typed metadata response.
- Outputs: uploaded attachment metadata or typed error response.
- Failure modes: missing note id, missing file, invalid metadata, blob
  write failure, metadata persistence failure.
- Retry/cancel behavior: caller may retry after transport/storage
  failure; duplicate handling belongs to the owning real domain when
  product requirements demand it.
- Tests: `api/handlers/notes/attachments_handler_test.go`,
  `api/internal/notes/attachments_service_test.go`,
  `api/internal/notes/flow/flow_test.go`,
  `ui/src/features/notes/AttachmentUpload.test.tsx`, and
  `ui/src/features/notes/flow/flow.test.ts`.
- Generated subpackages: `api/internal/notes/flow/generated/`
  (`model.qnt`, `artifact.json`, `runtime.go`, `replay.go`) and
  `ui/src/features/notes/flow/generated/` (`model.qnt`, `artifact.json`,
  `runtime.ts`, `replay.helper.ts`).
- Requirements: template starter only.

## State Machines

| Domain/Flow | States | Illegal Transitions | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| notes / attachment upload API | received, bytes_stored, metadata_recorded, failed | metadata before bytes, terminal-state escape, duplicate terminal events | `*.flow.json` contract, generated Quint model, generated formal artifact replay, side-effect cleanup tests |
| notes / attachment upload UI | idle, selected, uploading, succeeded, failed | start before select, stale completion after reset/reselect, retry without file context | `*.flow.json` contract, generated Quint model, generated formal artifact replay, attempt-id stale completion tests |

## Maturity Ladder

Temporal workflows mature in layers. Do not skip the executable layers
to add a standalone formal document.

| Level | Name | What exists |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Unmodeled risk | Lifecycle behavior exists only inside handlers, components, callbacks, or jobs. |
| 1 | Inventory | The flow is listed here with owner, source links, risk, and next step. |
| 2 | Workflow model | State/status values, event values, `Transition`, and `CheckInvariants` live beside the owning domain or feature. |
| 3 | Matrix + traces | Tests cover every state/event pair and replay representative traces against production transition logic. |
| 4 | Declarative contract | A domain-local `*.flow.json` declares states, events, transitions, invariants, and named traces. |
| 5 | Checked formal model | Quint/TLA+ or an equivalent tool is generated from the contract, checked, and replayed by production tests. |

## Production Shape

Three (Go) or four (UI) files per flow at the top of the feature folder,
plus one `generated/` sibling. Everything in `generated/` is codegen output.

Every flow lives in a `flow/` subdirectory next to its consumer with
conventional file names. API domains that own durable lifecycle state use:

```text
api/internal/<domain>/
  flow/
    flow.json                   # hand: source of truth (schema v6)
    transition.go               # hand: wrapper (package flow)
    flow_test.go                # hand: thin replay delegation (package flow)
    generated/
      model.qnt
      artifact.json
      runtime.go                # package generated
      replay.go
```

UI features that own client-side modes use:

```text
ui/src/features/<domain>/
  flow/
    flow.json                   # hand: source of truth (schema v6)
    transition.ts               # hand: wrapper
    fixtures.ts                 # hand: replay fixtures
    flow.test.ts                # hand: thin replay delegation
    generated/
      model.qnt
      artifact.json
      runtime.ts
      replay.helper.ts
```

Every flow uses the same file names. The `flow/` directory IS the unit;
the contract no longer declares any output paths or module names.

The workflow owns state/status values, events, `Transition`, and
`CheckInvariants`. It should be pure or nearly pure. Effects live
outside the workflow behind seams: repositories, BlobStore, clocks,
timers, HTTP clients, or UI API modules.

The `*.flow.json` contract is the source of truth. Level 5 generated
Quint models, formal artifacts, and Go/TypeScript declarations are
checked-in source artifacts for reviewability, but they are refreshed
and checked by the `flow-verifier` scenario CLI; the
scenario lifecycle runs `make temporal-models` (which calls
`flow-verifier verify check`) before the normal test
suite. A Quint file by itself is not accepted: the model must typecheck,
test, verify named invariants, emit deterministic artifacts, and those
artifacts must replay against the production Go/TypeScript transition
functions.

The generated declarations keep state/event topology and formal
freshness metadata out of hand-maintained test lists. They also provide
pure status-transition helpers generated from the `*.flow.json`
transition matrix. For TypeScript flows, the same declarations can own
the discriminated state/event union shape and replay fixture contract.
Production workflow wrappers call those helpers for abstract validity
and next-status outcomes, while keeping payload validation, side-effect
orchestration, and rich state construction in hand-authored code. API
replay tests get expected paths, hashes, invariants, and generated checks
from `generated/<folder>/runtime.go`; UI replay tests import the same metadata
from `generated/<folder>/runtime.ts`. The generated `replay.{go,helper.ts}`
files own the assertion calls; the hand-authored top-level test simply binds
the wrapper's transition function and the fixtures and invokes
`RunReplay`/`runFormalReplay` once.

Formal artifacts use schema v6 coverage metadata. Matrix completeness,
terminal transition checks, named trace coverage, and generated MBT trace
coverage are separate fields. Do not treat generated trace
`allPairsCovered` as required proof of correctness; replay tests require
the complete transition matrix and named traces, while generated trace
coverage reports how much the model explorer happened to visit.

Schema v6 `flow.json` files carry no path or module information. The
`replay` block declares only `transition.function` (plus
`transition.statusAccessor` for TS or `transition.stateType` /
`transition.statusField` for Go). Everything else is derived from the
flow directory.

Go flows emit `flow/generated/replay.go` and require a hand-authored
`flow/flow_test.go` (package `flow`) that calls `generated.RunReplay`.
TypeScript flows emit `flow/generated/replay.helper.ts` and require a
hand-authored `flow/flow.test.ts` that calls
`runFormalReplay({ transition, fixtures })` at module top level.
`flow-verifier verify check` byte-compares every generated file and runs an
AST-level lint over the hand-authored test, so a silent bypass — missing
import, stubbed transition, or call buried inside a guarded block —
fails the check.

To scaffold a new flow:

```bash
flow-verifier flows new ui/src/features/<feature> --flow-id <flow-id> --lang ts --root .
flow-verifier flows new api/internal/<domain>     --flow-id <flow-id> --lang go --root .
```

The scaffold writes the hand-authored files and immediately runs
`generate`, so `check` is green from the moment it returns.

To add or rename a state/event:

1. Edit the owning `*.flow.json`.
2. Regenerate that flow with `flow-verifier verify run --flow <flow-id>`.
3. Update only payload-specific wrapper branches that need new runtime
   data; the abstract transition table is generated.
4. Update the UI replay fixture module. The generated formal replay fixture
   interface should make missing state/event fixtures a type error.
5. Run `make temporal-models` and the scenario tests.
