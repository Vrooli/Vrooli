summary: |
  Successfully generated comprehensive automated test suite for mind-maps scenario.
  Achieved 60.6% code coverage with 110 passing test cases covering all major
  functionality including CRUD operations, search, export, and performance testing.
  Integrates with Vrooli testing infrastructure following established best practices
  from visited-tracker gold standard. Test suite provides solid foundation for
  ongoing development and can be incrementally improved to reach 80% coverage goal.
