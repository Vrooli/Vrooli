# Domains — Signal Inbox

This document is the canonical map of product capabilities, bounded
contexts, and ownership for this scenario. Keep it current whenever a
domain is added, renamed, split, merged, or removed.

`health` is the one real domain the scaffold ships. Add your scenario's
domains to the inventory below as you build them. The scaffold also ships
one clearly fenced worked example domain (never product scope) as a
copyable reference; `template-manager detemplate <scenario>` removes every
fenced example once your real domains are green.

## Purpose Of This Document

Use this document to answer:

- What product capabilities does this scenario expose?
- Which domain owns each concept, table, proto, endpoint, UI feature,
  CLI command, and test surface?
- Which concepts are shared, deferred, or deliberately not domains?

System-level architecture belongs in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).
Workflow details belong in [`FLOWS.md`](FLOWS.md). Storage details
belong in [`DATA.md`](DATA.md).

## Domain Inventory

| Domain | Responsibility | Purpose | Owns Data | Primary Archetype | Secondary Traits | Glossary | Source Paths |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| health | Report runtime readiness and dependency reachability. | Expose API/database readiness and show the UI can read live backend state. | No product data. | reporting | query | HealthHandler | `api/handlers/health/`, `ui/src/features/health/`, `packages/proto/schemas/signal-inbox/v1/shared/health.proto` |
| signals | Own the append-only journal of captured material. | Guarantee that anything captured is stored exactly once and never lost. | `signal` (immutable), content-hash index. | crud | service | Signal, SourceIdentity, ContentHash | `api/internal/signals/`, `api/handlers/signals/`, `cli/domains/signals/`, `ui/src/features/signals/` |
| sources | Register source adapters, enforce risk tiers, and run imports. | Get material in without risking the operator's platform accounts. | `adapter_state`, `import_run`. | service | workflow | Adapter, RiskTier, SafetyEnvelope, ImportRun | `api/internal/sources/`, `api/handlers/sources/`, `cli/domains/sources/`, `ui/src/features/sources/` |
| enrichment | Resolve a source to text, delegating to the scenario that owns each medium. | Make a signal readable and embeddable regardless of what it arrived as. | No tables; writes extracted content to `signals`. | service | integration | Extractor, ExtractionResult | `api/internal/enrichment/` |
| categories | Own the operator's category set, taxonomies, and classification. | Organize the corpus the way the operator thinks about it, not the way the system does. | `category`, `taxonomy`, `classification`. | crud | service | Category, Taxonomy, Proposal, Confirmation | `api/internal/categories/`, `api/handlers/categories/`, `cli/domains/categories/`, `ui/src/features/categories/` |
| triage | Own disposition, annotations, outcome links, and the review queue. | Make a signal's handled-state and its history legible, so nothing is reconsidered twice. | `disposition`, `annotation`. | workflow | crud | Disposition, Annotation, OutcomeLink | `api/internal/triage/`, `api/handlers/triage/`, `cli/domains/triage/`, `ui/src/features/triage/` |
| retrieval | Own structured query, semantic search, the ambient view, and federation. | Answer both exact and natural-language questions over the whole corpus. | `embedding` index; owns the search descriptor. | reporting | query, integration | Query, AmbientView, ProviderDescriptor | `api/internal/retrieval/`, `api/handlers/retrieval/`, `cli/domains/retrieval/`, `ui/src/features/search/`, `.vrooli/search.json` |

### Example domain — `notes` (removed by `template-manager detemplate`)

The template ships `notes` as a worked CRUD vertical slice with a binary
upload exception. Copy its shape for your own domains, then remove it.

| Domain | Responsibility | Purpose | Owns Data | Primary Archetype | Secondary Traits | Glossary | Source Paths |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| notes | Provide the worked CRUD reference with attachment upload exception. | Demonstrate the expected vertical slice for a real domain. | Notes and attachment metadata. | crud | service | Note, Attachment | `api/internal/notes/`, `api/handlers/notes/`, `cli/domains/notes/`, `ui/src/features/notes/`, `packages/proto/schemas/signal-inbox/v1/notes/` |

- Purpose: demonstrate the expected vertical slice for a real domain.
- Primary archetype: CRUD / entity.
- Secondary traits: binary/blob attachment upload, upload workflow.
- Owns: note records, attachment metadata, note validation, note
  service/repository seams, UI note interactions, CLI notes commands.
- Does not own: product scope for a generated scenario.
- API: `api/internal/notes/`, `api/handlers/notes/`.
- CLI: `cli/domains/notes/`.
- UI: `ui/src/features/notes/`, `ui/src/api/notes.ts`.
- Storage: domain-owned SQLite schema in `api/internal/notes/schema.sql`.
- Requirements: template starter only; replace with PRD-specific
  requirements.
- Tests: repository, service, handler, CLI, UI, accessibility, and
  workflow tests.
- Related docs: [`FLOWS.md`](FLOWS.md), [`DATA.md`](DATA.md),
  [`../internal/SEAMS.md`](../internal/SEAMS.md).

## Domain Details

### health

- Purpose: expose API/database readiness and show the UI can read live
  backend state.
- Primary archetype: reporting / query.
- Secondary traits: operational health.
- Owns: health response construction and dependency status mapping.
- Does not own: product data, business rules, or scenario-specific
  domain behavior.
- API: `api/handlers/health/`.
- CLI: built-in `status` command is provided through cli-core.
- UI: `ui/src/features/health/HealthCard.tsx`.
- Storage: none; probes configured database reachability.
- Requirements: starter scaffold health only.
- Tests: handler, module, UI feature, and accessibility tests.
- Related docs: [`../reference/api-endpoints.md`](../reference/api-endpoints.md).

## Shared Concepts

| Concept | Meaning | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Domain | Product capability boundary that should be easy to find, test, and delete. | `DOMAINS.md` defines the map; code owns implementation. |
| Surface | API, UI, CLI, or contract layer exposing the same product capability. | `ARCHITECTURE.md`. |
| Seam | Test-substitutable boundary wired once in production. | `../internal/SEAMS.md`. |
| Requirement | Implementation-facing measurement tied back to the PRD. | `requirements/`. |

## Deferred Domains

Add future or intentionally deferred capabilities here only when they
are real enough to affect architecture or requirements.

| Candidate Domain | Why Deferred | Revisit Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| None yet. | Generated scaffold. | Add after PRD-specific requirements identify future capability boundaries. |

## Non-Domains

These are important but should not become product domains:

- `api/internal/server/` — HTTP composition substrate.
- `api/internal/module/` — shared module descriptor type.
- `api/internal/modules/` — thin registry for boot/codegen.
- `api/internal/database/` — cross-cutting database infrastructure.
- `api/internal/testutil/` — cross-domain test harnesses.
- `ui/src/components/` — shared presentation primitives.
- `ui/src/test-utils/` — cross-feature testing support.

If one of these starts using product vocabulary, split the product
piece into an owning domain instead of growing infrastructure.
