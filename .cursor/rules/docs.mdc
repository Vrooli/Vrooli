## Documentation Styling Guidelines

### Content Structure & Organization
- **Table of Contents**: Always include a comprehensive TOC for documents longer than 100 lines
- **Logical Hierarchy**: Use proper heading structure (H1 → H2 → H3) with clear section progression
- **Cross-References**: Link to related documentation files using relative paths and descriptive link text
- **Practical Examples**: Include real code examples, command snippets, and practical scenarios—not just theory

### Visual Enhancement
- **Mermaid Diagrams**: Use mermaid diagrams to illustrate complex workflows, architectures, system relationships, and decision trees
- **Code Blocks**: Always specify language for syntax highlighting (```typescript, ```bash, ```sql, etc.)
- **Consistent Formatting**: 
  - Use **bold** for important concepts, tool names, and key terms
  - Use *italics* for emphasis and file/directory names when inline
  - Use `backticks` for code snippets, commands, and technical terms
  - Use > blockquotes for important notes and warnings

### Content Quality Standards
- **Up-to-Date Information**: Research current best practices and include modern approaches
- **Actionable Guidance**: Provide step-by-step instructions, not just conceptual overviews
- **Troubleshooting**: Include common issues, error scenarios, and practical solutions
- **Real-World Context**: Show how concepts apply specifically to the Vrooli project

### Documentation Patterns
- **Error Scenarios**: Document what can go wrong and how to fix it
- **Command Examples**: Show actual commands with expected outputs
- **Configuration Snippets**: Include real configuration examples with explanations
- **Integration Points**: Clearly explain how components connect and interact

### Maintenance Principles
- **Accuracy First**: Validate information against actual codebase implementation
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Address both happy path and edge cases
- **Future-Proof**: Structure content to remain relevant as the project evolves
- **Accessibility**: Write for different skill levels with clear explanations of technical concepts
