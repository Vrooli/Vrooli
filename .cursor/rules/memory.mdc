You have no persistent memory - your memory resets completely between sessions. This design choice ensures you maintain impeccable, clear, and thorough documentation. **After every memory reset, you rely solely on files in /docs.** This acts as your long-term memory back. Reading **ALL** required /docs files at the start of every task is mandatory and non-negotiable.

## Memory Bank (Documenation) Structure

All documentation files are Markdown files, structured clearly to maintain context and progress continuity across resets.

### Core Files (Always Required):

- **[context.md](mdc:docs/context.md)**
  - Overview of project purpose and goals  
  - Business and technical rationale  
  - User experience expectations and core functionality

- **[decisions.md](mdc:docs/decisions.md)**  
  - Major project decisions  
  - Justifications for each decision  
  - Impact and consequences of decisions

- **[risks.md](mdc:docs/risks.md)**  
  - Technical, strategic, operational risks  
  - Risk severity and potential impacts  
  - Mitigation strategies

- **[roadmap.md](mdc:docs/roadmap.md)**  
  - Project milestones  
  - Future vision and long-term goals  
  - Realistic timelines for delivery

- **[tools.md](mdc:docs/tools.md)**
  - Commands and tools available to you, typically within the terminal

### Task Management (`/docs/tasks/` folder):

Tasks are clearly organized and managed through multiple Markdown files categorized by their status:

- **[active.md](mdc:docs/tasks/active.md)** : Tasks currently underway
- **[background.md](mdc:docs/docs/about/background.md)**: Unstructured, quick notes, and ideas awaiting research and clarification
- **[staged.md](mdc:docs/tasks/staged.md)**: Tasks that have been clarified, researched, and structured but not yet started
- **[completed.md](mdc:docs/tasks/completed.md)**: Finished tasks with clear documentation on outcomes
- **[failed.md](mdc:docs/tasks/failed.md)**: Tasks that have been abandoned or blocked permanently, including reasons and lessons learned

### Temporary Working Files (`/docs/scratch` folder):

- Temporary notes, research results, or drafts generated during the current task
- Clear out or transfer important information after confirmation of task completion

### Project Documentation (`docs/` folder):

Organized documentation covering technical details, integrations, testing, deployments, APIs, and guides.

Recommended organization:

- **Deployment:** Guides for Kubernetes, Docker, serverless deployments, etc.
  - `deploy-kubernetes.md`
  - `deploy-docker.md`

- **Testing:** Documentation for performance, mobile, unit, integration, and end-to-end testing strategies
  - `testing-performance.md`
  - `testing-mobile.md`
  - `testing-strategies.md`

- **API Reference:**
  - Clearly structured API endpoint details, usage, and examples
  - `api-reference.md`

- **Integrations and Infrastructure:** Documentation for third-party integrations, cloud setup, and infrastructure specifics
  - `integrations.md`
  - `infrastructure.md`

- **Other:** Additional docs as necessary (e.g., architectural diagrams, security standards)

## Agent Core Workflows

### Initialization Workflow

Every task session begins by reading **ALL** Memory Bank files:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Start --> ReadAll[Read ALL Memory Bank Files]
  ReadAll --> VerifyContext[Verify Completeness and Context Clarity]
  VerifyContext --> DecideAction{Ready to Proceed?}
  DecideAction -->|Yes| Act[Continue with Task]
  DecideAction -->|No| Clarify[Request Clarifications]
```

### Documentation Update Workflow

Trigger documentation updates when:

- New project patterns or important insights are identified
- Significant project decisions are made or implemented
- User explicitly requests with **"update memory bank"** (requires reviewing **all files**)
- Context becomes outdated or ambiguous

Prioritize updating `active.md`, `backlog.md`, `staged.md`, `completed.md`, and core docs (`context.md`, `decisions.md`, `risks.md`, `roadmap.md`).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Trigger[Documentation Update Triggered]
  Trigger --> Review[Review ALL Memory Bank Files]
  Review --> UpdateTasks[Update Tasks & Task States]
  UpdateTasks --> UpdateCore[Update Core Docs & Context]
  UpdateCore --> Summarize[Summarize Updates Clearly]
```

### Task Execution Workflow

```mermaid

  Start[Start Task] --> CheckMemory[Check & Read Memory Bank]
  CheckMemory --> UpdateDocs[Update Docs if Needed]
  UpdateDocs --> ExecuteTask[Perform Task]
  ExecuteTask --> UpdateTasks[Update Task Status & Outcomes]
  UpdateTasks --> Summarize[Summarize & Document Results]
```

## Key Rules to Remember:

- **Always** start by reading **every** required memory file.
- Maintain each file’s integrity and organization rigorously—clarity is critical.
- Clearly document decisions, changes, task outcomes, and discovered insights.
- Update the documentation regularly, proactively, and thoroughly—your effectiveness depends solely on its completeness and accuracy.
- Use `/docs/scratch/` for temporary working information; transfer finalized insights and important details to permanent documenation files before clearing.

This structured and disciplined documentation approach ensures continuous progress and clarity, no matter how many resets occur.
