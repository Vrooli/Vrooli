You have no persistent memory - your memory resets completely between sessions. This design choice ensures you maintain impeccable, clear, and thorough documentation. **After every memory reset, you rely solely on files in the `/docs` folder.** This acts as your long-term memory back. Reading **ALL** relevant `/docs` files at the start of every task is mandatory and non-negotiable.

## Memory Bank (Documenation) Structure

All documentation files are Markdown files, structured clearly to maintain context and progress continuity across resets.

### Core Files (Always Required):

- **[context.md](mdc:docs/context.md)**
  - Overview of project purpose and goals  
  - Business and technical rationale  
  - User experience expectations and core functionality

- **[decisions.md](mdc:docs/decisions.md)**  
  - Major project decisions  
  - Justifications for each decision  
  - Impact and consequences of decisions

- **[risks.md](mdc:docs/risks.md)**  
  - Technical, strategic, operational risks  
  - Risk severity and potential impacts  
  - Mitigation strategies

- **[roadmap.md](mdc:docs/roadmap.md)**  
  - Project milestones  
  - Future vision and long-term goals  
  - Realistic timelines for delivery

- **[tools.md](mdc:docs/tools.md)**
  - Commands and tools available to you, typically within the terminal

### Task Management (`/docs/tasks/` folder):

Tasks are clearly organized and managed through multiple Markdown files categorized by their status:

- **[active.md](mdc:docs/tasks/active.md)** : Tasks currently underway
- **[backlog.md](mdc:docs/tasks/backlog.md)**: Unstructured, quick notes, and ideas awaiting research and clarification
- **[staged.md](mdc:docs/tasks/staged.md)**: Tasks that have been clarified, researched, and structured but not yet started
- **[completed.md](mdc:docs/tasks/completed.md)**: Finished tasks with clear documentation on outcomes
- **[failed.md](mdc:docs/tasks/failed.md)**: Tasks that have been abandoned or blocked permanently, including reasons and lessons learned

### Temporary Working Files (`/docs/scratch` folder):

- Temporary notes, research results, or drafts generated during the current task
- Clear out or transfer important information after confirmation of task completion

### Project Documentation (`docs/` folder and its subdirectories):

Organized documentation covering technical details, integrations, testing, deployments, APIs, architecture, and guides.
Documentation can be found as:
- Standalone guides directly within the `/docs` folder (e.g., `executor-migration-guide.md`, `run-state-machine-migration-guide.md`).
- Grouped within subdirectories like `/docs/server/`, `/docs/architecture/`, `/docs/testing/`, `/docs/ui/`, `/docs/devops/`, `/docs/setup/`. Each subdirectory typically contains a `README.md` and other relevant files.

Current structure includes:

- **Server Documentation (`/docs/server/`)**: Backend architecture, startup process, and database migrations
  - `README.md` - Server overview and architecture
  - `database-migrations.md` - Detailed migration procedures

- **Architecture (`/docs/architecture/`)**: System design and architectural decisions
  - `README.md` - Architecture overview
  - Subdirectories: `execution/`, `external-integrations/`, `data/`, `core-services/`, `api-gateway/`, `client/`

- **Testing (`/docs/testing/`)**: Comprehensive testing documentation
  - `README.md` - Testing overview
  - `test-strategy.md`, `test-plan.md`, `test-execution.md`, `writing-tests.md`, `defect-reporting.md`

- **UI Documentation (`/docs/ui/`)**: Frontend and user interface documentation
  - `README.md` - UI overview
  - `ui-performance.md`, `logo.md`, `pwa-and-twa.md`, `fonts.md`

- **DevOps (`/docs/devops/`)**: Deployment, infrastructure, and operational guides
  - `README.md` - DevOps overview
  - `server-deployment.md`, `kubernetes.md`, `ci-cd.md`, `build-system.md`, `development-environment.md`, `environment-management.md`, `logging.md`, `testing-infrastructure.md`, `troubleshooting.md`
  - Subdirectory: `getting-started/`

- **Setup (`/docs/setup/`)**: Installation and configuration instructions
  - `README.md` - Setup overview
  - `prerequisites.md`, `repo_setup.md`, `remote_setup.md`, `working_with_docker.md`, `oauth_setup.md`, `stripe_setup.md`, `s3_setup.md`, `cloudflare_caching.md`, `messenger_setup.md`

- **Migration Guides**: Standalone technical migration documentation
  - `executor-migration-guide.md`
  - `run-state-machine-migration-guide.md`

For new documentation, follow the existing pattern by placing content in appropriate subdirectories or as standalone files in `/docs/` for cross-cutting concerns.

## Agent Core Workflows

### Initialization Workflow

Every task session begins by reading **ALL** Memory Bank files:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Start --> ReadAll[Read ALL Memory Bank Files]
  ReadAll --> VerifyContext[Verify Completeness and Context Clarity]
  VerifyContext --> DecideAction{Ready to Proceed?}
  DecideAction -->|Yes| Act[Continue with Task]
  DecideAction -->|No| Clarify[Request Clarifications]
```

### Documentation Update Workflow

Trigger documentation updates when:

- New project patterns or important insights are identified
- Significant project decisions are made or implemented
- User explicitly requests with **"update memory bank"** (requires reviewing **all files**)
- Context becomes outdated or ambiguous

Prioritize updating `active.md`, `backlog.md`, `staged.md`, `completed.md`, and core docs (`context.md`, `decisions.md`, `risks.md`, `roadmap.md`).

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Trigger[Documentation Update Triggered]
  Trigger --> Review[Review ALL Memory Bank Files]
  Review --> UpdateTasks[Update Tasks & Task States]
  UpdateTasks --> UpdateCore[Update Core Docs & Context]
  UpdateCore --> Summarize[Summarize Updates Clearly]
```

### Task Execution Workflow

```mermaid

  Start[Start Task] --> CheckMemory[Check & Read Memory Bank]

  UpdateDocs --> ExecuteTask[Perform Task]
  ExecuteTask --> UpdateTasks[Update Task Status & Outcomes]
  UpdateTasks --> Summarize[Summarize & Document Results]
```

## Key Rules to Remember:

- **Always** start by reading **every** required memory file.
- Maintain each file's integrity and organization rigorously—clarity is critical.
- Clearly document decisions, changes, task outcomes, and discovered insights.
- Update the documentation regularly, proactively, and thoroughly—your effectiveness depends solely on its completeness and accuracy.
- Use `/docs/scratch/` for temporary working information; transfer finalized insights and important details to permanent documenation files before clearing.

This structured and disciplined documentation approach ensures continuous progress and clarity, no matter how many resets occur.
