You are working on Vrooli - a **self-improving intelligence system** where agents build tools that make future agents smarter in an infinite recursive loop. This is NOT just an automation platform.

## ⚡ Essential Commands
- `vrooli help` - See all available commands
- `vrooli test help` - See test commands  
- `vrooli develop` - Start development environment
- `./scripts/main/setup.sh --yes yes` - Initial setup

## 🧠 Understanding Vrooli's True Nature

### Core Vision
- **Recursive Intelligence**: Every app built becomes a permanent capability
- **Compound Learning**: System literally cannot forget solutions, only improves
- **Shared Resources**: Apps share N8n, Redis, Qdrant, PostgreSQL to collaborate
- **Scenarios = Businesses**: Not tests! Each scenario generates $10K-50K value

### The Intelligence Loop
1. Agent solves problem → Solution crystallized as app/workflow
2. Future agents use solution as building block → More complex problems solvable
3. Each iteration makes ALL future iterations more powerful → ∞

## 📋 Task Management
Use keywords to trigger commands:
- **"organize next task"** - Process first unstructured task
- **"start next task"** - Begin highest priority task
- **"update task statuses"** - Review and update progress
- **"research"** - Deep dive on topics
- **"suggest new tasks"** - Analyze for improvements

## 🔧 AI Maintenance Tracking
- Before work: `rg "AI_CHECK:.*TASK_ID" --type ts`
- After work: `// AI_CHECK: TASK_ID=count | LAST: YYYY-MM-DD`
- Details: `/docs/ai-maintenance/README.md`

## ❌ Critical Rules
1. **NEVER** create files unless absolutely necessary
2. **ALWAYS** prefer editing existing files
3. **NEVER** install packages without permission
4. **NEVER** create documentation unless explicitly requested
5. **ALWAYS** read `/docs/context.md` and CLAUDE.md at session start

## 📁 Documentation Structure
Core files to read at session start:
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Primary instructions (this overrides defaults!)
- `/docs/context.md` - Project overview
- `/docs/tasks/active.md` - Current work
- `/docs/scratch/` - Previous session notes

## 🎯 Remember The Mission
Every line of code becomes **permanent intelligence** the system uses forever. You're not building features - you're expanding the system's ability to understand and solve problems autonomously.

**When in doubt:** Read `/CLAUDE.md` - it contains the most up-to-date instructions and overrides everything else.
