Below are detailed commands you may receive. Users may trigger these workflows with a single phrase containing keywords listed below. **Always match commands based on provided keywords.**

## **Organize Next Task**

**Keywords:**  
_"organize next task," "structure task," "clarify next task," "organize backlog," "prepare next task"_

Process the **first unstructured task** in the [background.md](mdc:docs/docs/about/background.md):

1. **Explore the Codebase:**
   - Search relevant files and code patterns thoroughly.
   - Analyze existing implementations of similar tasks.
   - Determine integration points within the architecture.
   - Identify implicit or missing dependencies.

2. **Clarify and Research:**
   - Ask targeted clarifying questions if the task is incomplete or unclear.
   - Conduct detailed research on unfamiliar technical concepts.

3. **Decide on Splitting Tasks:**
   - If the implementation clearly spans multiple files or separate logical components, split the task into multiple, focused subtasks.
   - Clearly indicate reasoning for splitting and maintain consistent formatting for all subtasks.

4. **Refine and Document (directly in TASKS.md):**
   - Follow the established task template (title, priority, status, dependencies).
   - Provide a clear description of technical approaches, potential strategies, and affected files.
   - Break down each task or subtask into manageable deliverables.

5. **Finalize:**
   - Remove original unstructured task entry.
   - Flag tasks or subtasks still needing information, with specific follow-up questions.

## **Reprioritize Tasks**

**Keywords:**  
_"reprioritize tasks," "reorder backlog," "adjust task priorities," "prioritize tasks"_

- Evaluate all tasks and update priorities (**HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW**) based on:
  - Business impact
  - Technical urgency
  - Dependencies
  - Current project objectives
- Include concise justification for priority changes, reorder tasks accordingly.

---

## **Suggest New Tasks**

**Keywords:**  
_"suggest tasks," "recommend improvements," "identify gaps," "propose new tasks"_

- Identify potential gaps in:
  - Technical infrastructure
  - User experience
  - Documentation quality
  - Testing coverage
  - Security practices
- Clearly propose new tasks formatted using the established task template for user review.

---

## **Update Task Status**

**Keywords:**  
_"update task statuses," "refresh tasks," "task progress update," "update backlog"_

- Review tasks, updating:
  - Status (**TODO/IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED/DONE**)
  - Progress indicators
  - Newly identified blockers or dependencies

---

## **Cleanup Task List**

**Keywords:**  
_"cleanup backlog," "merge duplicates," "split large tasks," "archive completed tasks," "cleanup tasks"_

- Merge duplicated tasks.
- Split tasks that are too large or complex.
- Archive completed tasks clearly into "Completed Tasks" section.
- Ensure consistent task formatting and sufficient detail throughout.

---

## **Start Next Task**

**Keywords:**  
_"start next task," "pick task," "begin task," "go," "work next," "start working"_

- Select the highest-priority task from the backlog, preferring tasks closely related to recently completed work to reduce context switching.
- Explore the codebase to determine feasible implementation strategies.
- Draft and present a brief implementation plan clearly stating the approach and alternatives for confirmation.
- Upon confirmation, set task status to **IN_PROGRESS**.
- Wait for explicit confirmation before marking the task as **DONE** and moving it to the "Completed Tasks" section.

---

## **Update Documentation**

**Keywords:**  
_"update documentation," "refresh docs," "sync documentation," "update docs"_

- Review existing documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, guides, and inline comments).
- Identify and note discrepancies, outdated sections, missing context, or incomplete explanations.
- Update or expand documentation clearly to reflect current codebase state and practices.
- Propose new sections if documentation gaps are identified.
- Clearly summarize documentation updates performed.

---

## **Engage**

**Keywords:**  
_"engage," "prompt me," "interaction," "check-in"_

Clearly prompt the user:  
> _"Would you like me to review and update our task list, or should I start working on a backlog item?"_  

Wait for user's input.

---

## **Research**

**Keywords:**
_"research," "investigate," "explore topic," "find info on," "deep dive"_

Perform in-depth research on a specified topic to understand how it can be implemented within the *Vrooli* project:

1.  **Define Scope:**
    *   Clarify the research topic and its specific goals in relation to the project's architecture, features, or requirements.
    *   Ask clarifying questions if the topic or its connection to the project is unclear.

2.  **Information Gathering (Web Search):**
    *   Utilize web search capabilities to gather comprehensive information.
    *   Prioritize official documentation, specifications, setup guides, tutorials, and reputable technical articles.
    *   Look for examples, best practices, and potential pitfalls related to the topic.

3.  **Analyze and Synthesize:**
    *   Extract key concepts, implementation steps, required dependencies, and configuration details.
    *   Analyze how the researched technology or concept could integrate with the existing *Vrooli* codebase (`/src`). Consider potential conflicts or necessary adaptations.
    *   Evaluate the feasibility, benefits, and drawbacks of implementation.

4.  **Document Findings:**
    *   Summarize the research findings clearly and concisely.
    *   Include direct links to the most important sources (official docs, key guides).
    *   Outline potential implementation strategies or next steps for integrating the researched element into the project.
    *   Store detailed findings or lengthy notes in a new file within `/docs/scratch/` for temporary reference.

5.  **Present Results:**
    *   Present the summarized findings, key links, and proposed integration points or next steps to the user.
