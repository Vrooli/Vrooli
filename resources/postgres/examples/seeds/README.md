## Usage Notes

Treat these files as reusable SQL seed bundles.

- Execute the files in numeric order within each domain directory.
- Use the resource [README](../../README.md) and [docs](../../docs/) for the current operator flow.

## 🎯 Integration with Automation

### n8n Workflows
The seeded data is designed to work with n8n automation workflows:

- **Real Estate**: Lead capture forms → CRM updates → Follow-up emails
- **Ecommerce**: Order webhooks → Inventory updates → Customer notifications  
- **SaaS**: Usage metrics → Billing triggers → Support ticket routing

### Node-RED Dashboards
Create real-time monitoring dashboards:

- **Real Estate**: Property views, lead conversion rates, agent performance
- **Ecommerce**: Sales metrics, inventory levels, customer activity
- **SaaS**: Tenant usage, subscription health, support queue

### Example n8n Connection
```javascript
// n8n PostgreSQL node configuration
{
  "host": "postgres-my-client",
  "port": 5432,
  "database": "vrooli_client", 
  "user": "vrooli",
  "password": "[from instance config]"
}
```

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding Your Own Seed Data
1. Create new directory: `seeds/your-industry/`
2. Add SQL files with sequential numbering
3. Include table creation and sample data
4. Update this README with your use case

### Template Integration
The seed data automatically works with client templates:
- `real-estate` template → `seeds/real-estate/`
- `ecommerce` template → `seeds/ecommerce/`
- `saas` template → `seeds/saas/`

### Data Privacy
- All seed data uses fictional names and addresses
- No real customer or business information included
- Safe for development and testing environments
