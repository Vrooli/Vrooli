# 03 - Advanced Features

This section explores advanced capabilities and patterns for complex automation.

## Prerequisites

Complete sections [01-getting-started](../01-getting-started/) and [02-basic-automation](../02-basic-automation/) first.

## Examples in this section

### automation_sequences.py
Create complex multi-step automation workflows:
- Sequential task execution
- Conditional logic
- Error handling
- State management

```bash
python automation_sequences.py
```

### comprehensive_demo.py
A full-featured demonstration showing:
- All automation capabilities
- Performance considerations
- Best practices
- Real-world patterns

```bash
python comprehensive_demo.py
```

### region_detection.py
Work with specific screen regions:
- Find elements on screen
- Region-based automation
- Visual pattern matching
- Dynamic element location

```bash
python region_detection.py
```

### error_recovery.py
Build robust automations:
- Handle failures gracefully
- Retry mechanisms
- Fallback strategies
- Logging and debugging

```bash
python error_recovery.py
```

### performance_optimization.py
Optimize your automations:
- Batch operations
- Parallel execution
- Resource management
- Timing optimization

```bash
python performance_optimization.py
```

## Advanced Patterns

### 1. State Machines
Use state machines for complex workflows with multiple paths.

### 2. Event-Driven Automation
React to screen changes and events rather than fixed timing.

### 3. Hybrid Automation
Combine AI and deterministic automation for flexibility.

### 4. Distributed Automation
Run automations across multiple Agent S2 instances.

## Best Practices

1. **Always have fallbacks** - Plan for when things go wrong
2. **Log everything** - Detailed logs help debug issues
3. **Test incrementally** - Build complex automations step by step
4. **Monitor performance** - Track execution times and resource usage
5. **Version your automations** - Keep track of changes
