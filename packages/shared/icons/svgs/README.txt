This folder contains the SVG versions of site icons. 
These are not used by the site, as the site requires React component versions.

It is important that we have the SVG versions in case they need to be updated. 
The `generateSvgGallery.sh` script can also be used to generate an HTML 
file to view all of these icons at once.
