Optional fields must start with a question mark (e.g. ?field_name).  \n- **Additional fields**: If an object contains arbitrary fields, add a field with brackets (e.g. [variable]).  \n- **Data types**: Data types are specified by reserved words (e.g. &lt;string&gt;, &lt;number | boolean&gt;, &lt;any&gt;, etc.), variable names (e.g. &lt;variable_name&gt;), standard IDs (e.g. &lt;decdf6c8-4230-4777-b8e3-799df2503c42&gt;), or simply entered as normal JSON.",
