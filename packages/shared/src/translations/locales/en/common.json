Here you can create and edit multi-step routines.\n\n## What is a routine?\nA *routine* is simply a process for completing a task, which takes inputs, performs some action, and outputs some results. By connecting multiple routines together, you can perform arbitrarily complex tasks.\n\nAll valid multi-step routines have a *start* node and at least one *end* node. Each node inbetween stores a list of subroutines, which can be optional or required.\n\nWhen a user runs the routine, they traverse the routine graph from left to right. Each subroutine is rendered as a page, with components such as TextFields for each input. Where the graph splits, users are given a choice of which subroutine to go to next.\n\n## How do I build a multi-step routine?\nIf you are starting from scratch, you will see a *start* node, a *routine list* node, and an *end* node.\n\nYou can press the routine list node to toggle it open/closed. The *open* stats allows you to select existing subroutines from Vrooli, or create a new one.\n\nEach link connecting nodes has a circle. Pressing this circle opens a popup menu with options to insert a node, split the graph, or delete the link.\n\nYou also have the option to *unlink* nodes. These are stored on the top status bar - along with the status indicator, a button to clean up the graph, a button to add a new link, this help button, and an info button that sets overall routine information.",
