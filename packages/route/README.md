# What is this?
Route is a custom routing project forked from [wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) version 2.8.0-alpha.2.  

Using our own routing code allows us to simplify `Routes.tsx`, as well as easily store the previous pathname in sessionStorage to determine if an object page should be a dialog.
