/**
 * Handles transferring an object from one user to another. It works like this:
 * 1. The user who owns the object creates a transfer request
 * 2. If the user is transferring to an organization where they have the correct permissions, 
 *   the transfer is automatically accepted and the process is complete.
 * 3. Otherwise, a notification is sent to the user/org that is receiving the object,
 *   and they can accept or reject the transfer.
