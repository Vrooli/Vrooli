# [<img align="top" alt="YouTube" width="50px" src="./assets/youtube.svg" />][youtube] [What Is Vrooli?][youtube]

Vrooli is a collaborative and self-improving automation platform, aiming to automate entire organizations. When complete, here's how it will work:  
- Users create bots, which you can chat with and ask to complete tasks for you.
- Tasks are completed with routines, which are reusable building blocks that can combine standards, APIs, smart contracts, and more.
- Routines can be built for any purpose, including cognitive architectures for the bots themselves.
- Bots use cognitive routines to build and improve routines, notes, and other components.
- Routines, bots, and other components can be combined together to create an organization, where each bot takes on various roles.

## ü§î Why use Vrooli?
Vrooli keeps you organized and focused on your personal and professional goals. Here's how it differs from other projects:
- Routines can be shared and improved by anyone, and can be combined together to create new routines.
- The output of a routine can change drastically depending on the bot running it. An Edgar Allan Pot bot would complete a "Write a Book" routine differently than a Stephen King bot, for example.
- Anyone can copy a public organization, meaning they have access to business processes and on-demand employees for any purpose, for free.
- Standards can be created to define prompts, which allow you to quickly structure chat messages to bots.
- You can chat with multiple bots in the same conversation, as well as humans, and they can all work together to complete tasks.
- You can schedule routines to run at specific times, or when certain conditions are met.

- Define smart contracts
- API spec finished for calling smart contracts, storing an retrieving data, attaching custom interfaces to routines, and remaining automation features
- Create custom routine interfaces
- Call smart contracts from at least one blockchain
- Microtransactions implemented to pay for API calls, smart contract calls, and running custom interfaces
- Integration with DIDs, to act as a reputation system
- Routines can connect to IPNS (similar to IPFS, but updatable) for data storage. Other options to also be supported
- Decentralize all the things!
- Continual improvements and bug fixes, to ensure Vrooli is as best as can be.

## ü¶ú Multilingual Support

We are actively seeking multilingual speakers to help us translate Vrooli's user interface, documentation, and other resources to make our platform accessible to a wider audience. By providing translations, you will be playing a crucial role in expanding Vrooli's global reach and fostering an inclusive community that embraces diversity.

If you are a multilingual speaker and would like to contribute by providing translations, please follow these steps:

1. View our translations at packages/shared/translations/src/locales
2. Check if there is an existing translation folder for your language. If not, feel free to create a new folder for your language using the appropriate language code (e.g., es for Spanish, fr for French).
3. Start translating the resources within the folder. This may include user interface text, documentation, and tutorials. Make sure to maintain the original file structure and format.
4. Once you have completed your translation, submit a pull request. We will review your contribution and, if approved, merge it into the main repository.

We are incredibly grateful for your contributions and dedication to making Vrooli accessible to users across the globe. As a token of our appreciation, contributors will be immortalized in our release notes.

Thank you for your support and for helping us build a more inclusive and diverse Vrooli community!

## ü§ù Join the Team
Vrooli's vision is bright, but a lot of work needs to be done to get there. I would love to receive help for this project, but there are some things you need to know...

While this project aims for profitability, Vrooli is not structured as a traditional business. I'm just a developer with a vision; I don't want to manage employees, and I don't want to be obligated to respond to comments on a regular basis. Collaborators are welcome to suggest and complete tasks on [our project board](https://github.com/orgs/Vrooli/projects/1). Once we become profitable, I will add bounty rewards to tasks that are completed.

If you'd like to play a larger role in the development of this project, the following skills are welcome:
- **CEO/COO** - I'm looking for someone to help me manage the business side of things. This includes marketing, legal, and other business-related tasks. I'm also looking for someone to manage the community, and to help me make decisions on the direction of the project.
- **Kubernetes** - This project needs a Kubernetes cluster to scale. Some work has been completed to prepare for this, but there's still lots to go. I'm also looking for someone to help me setup a CI/CD pipeline.
- **API developers** - Calling APIs is a core feature of Vrooli. I'm leaning towards using [Chainlink's Any API](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/introduction/) to accomplish this, but I'm open to other solutions. Anyone who can help set this up will be greatly appreciated.
- **Crypto bros** - Utilizing smart contracts will be important in the future for decentralizing the platform. This will be required to automate governments.

Note that as AI and this project advances, these roles will start to become obsolete. We are trying to bring about a jobless future, after allüòä
