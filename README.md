Vrooli is a decentralized, collaborative automation platform designed to minimize the time between the inception of an idea and its development into a fully-functional product.

This is accomplished by combining the following core components into interoperable building blocks: 

* Interfaces
* APIs
* Smart Contracts
* Data
* Standards
* Containerization  

Each building block is called a *routine*, and they can be combined together without any coding experience - just simple drag-and-drop.

Routines can be used for rapid prototyping, reusable productivity workflows, and the automation of complex tasks.

## 👀 The Vision

While Artificial Intelligence will excel at generating text, driving, and other general tasks, it is not enough to maximize human productivity. Someone who doesn't know how to work on cars could be given an entire garage full of tools, and still not be able to fix their engine. What we need to reach the next level of productivity is a platform that minimizes the friction between our wants and how to achieve them.

To achieve this grand vision, we must think from first principles. What properties does this system need? We've identified the following:  
* <details>
  <summary><b>Combines all stages of productivity</b></summary>
  Ideas are born from a thirst for knowledge. They require research to validate, and resources to develop. What they <i>don't</i> have to do is cost a fortune, take months to years of education, and induce an extreme amount of stress to complete.
    <br>
    <br>
  Vrooli is designed to combine learning, research, and development into one flywheel, powered by community-generated routines. As the community grows, the process for creating and completing routines self-improves.
    <br>
    <br>
  Routines can be rapidly prototyped, and combined with auto-generated metrics and visuals to quickly display a project's utility to voters. In combination with <a href="https://projectcatalyst.org/resources/what-is-project-catalyst">Project Catalyst</a>, routines with the most impact can be funded by the Cardano treasury.
</details>

* <details>
  <summary><b>Consists of reusable building blocks</b></summary>
  The components that make up routines - interfaces, APIs, smart contracts, data, standards, and containers - can be reused and combined to create new routines.
    <br>
    <br>
  Routines themselves can be joined together to create new routines, which can be joined together to create more routines, and so on. This means a wide array of general-purpose routines can be built from a common set of building blocks.
</details>

* <details>
  <summary><b>Combines automated and human-driven tasks</b></summary>
  The ideal future is one where everything is automated. The problem is building these automated tasks. 
    <br>
    <br>
  To maximize adoption, we need to be able to facilitate the transition of routines from prototypes, to human-driven, to automated. Users interested in a prototype can star it, and watch it evolve over time as the community makes changes. Since each subroutine can individually be updated - by any of the routines that use it - performing tasks may become easier, cheaper, and quicker each time you use them.
    <br>
    <br>
  Prototypes have the added benefit of facilitating the development of services years in advance. The community can build prototypes on top of prototypes (and so on), to design the entire future of productivity. Using this, they can determine which subroutines, interfaces, smart contracts, etc. would be most benefitical to develop today.
</details>

* <details>
  <summary><b>Resistant to attacks</b></summary>
  Another hurdle to maximizing productivity is our governments. They are slow, inefficient, and favor the wants of the wealthy over the needs of the masses.
    <br>
    <br>
  There will be a time when decentralized governments are - in theory - superior in every way to centralized ones. At this point, it would be wise to run a mock decentralized government for a while, then switch over when it is proven to be effective.
    <br>
    <br>
  But our current governments won't give up their power without a fight. They will try everything they can to maintain the status quo. One of the most effective ways to do this is through money and productivity. This is why we must decentralize the means of production.
</details>

* <details>
  <summary><b>Easy for anyone to contribute. </b></summary>
  While the interfaces, APIs, and smart contracts all require coding, the ability to connect them together in novel ways - human creativity - can be contributed by anyone.
    <br>
    <br>
  Luckily, connecting routines together is all that is needed for rapid prototyping. This means that anyone has the ability to convey their idea to the community, and - if it's desirable - receive funding or find a team of developers to build it.
</details>

## 🤔 Why use Vrooli?
 Not only does Vrooli keep you organized and focused on your goals, but it also provides the same guidance to the rest of the community. Work routines can be built on top of each other, which simplifies the process of creating ever more complex routines.

**How can Vrooli be used to inspire entrepreneurs?** The simple process of stepping through a routine gives entrepreneurs assurance that they are on the right track. Seeing a routine's progress also provides a sense of accomplishment and motivation. Complicated or incomplete sections of popular routines can become great business proposals.

**How can Vrooli be used to automate tasks?** Vrooli has visions of becoming the "glue" of the automated world. If you're using routines to plan everything, connecting data and computation is the next logical step. The [project roadmap](#🔮-roadmap) details the timeline for this functionality.

## 🔮 Roadmap
 - Q1 2022 
    - ✅ Website launch. Users can create, comment, and vote on basic routines. 
    - ✅ Routines consist of a flowchart of steps. Each step can have a description and a list of useful resources.
 - Q2 2022
    - ✅ Routine visualizer improved.
    - ✅ Routines have the ability to reference other routines.
    - ✅ Routines can be created using the template of any existing routine.
    - "Request a Routine" section added.
 - Q3 2022
    - API fully defined for routine metadata. Supports all existing features, plus information required for data storage and automation.
    - Development started for connecting routines to specific user interfaces. This functionality allows for users to step through routines much easier, and is an important precursor for automation.
    - Integration with DIDs, to act as a reputation system.
- Q4 2022
    - Routines can connect to IPNS (similar to IPFS, but updatable) for data storage.
    - Ability for routines to trigger a smart contract.
    - Release of routine interface functionality.
- 2023 and beyond
    - Ability for users to create their own routine interfaces.
    - Decentralize all the things!
    - Continual improvements and bug fixes, to ensure Vrooli is as best as can be.
