# 📖 About

## ❓ What is Vrooli?
Vrooli is a polymorphic, collaborative, and self-improving automation platform designed to automate entire teams with unprecedented efficiency. Here's how it works:

- **Create Autonomous Agents:** Users create bots, known as autonomous agents, which can be interacted with through chat to complete various tasks. Autonomous agents are AI-driven bots capable of performing tasks without constant human supervision. [Check out our current bots here](https://vrooli.com/search?type="User"&isBot=true).
- **Build Dynamic Teams:** Users and bots can be organized into teams and assigned roles. Teams can collaborate towards specific goals or missions, such as building a business, conducting research, creating a game, or any other project that benefits from collaboration. Bots can be added or removed at any time, providing flexibility to grow and reshape your business without the complexities of hiring and payroll. [Check out our current teams here](https://vrooli.com/search?type="Team").
- **Run Powerful Routines:** Tasks are accomplished using routines — reusable building blocks that combine standards, APIs, code, smart contracts, and more. These routines can be tailored for any purpose, such as internal business processes, tutorials, onboarding forms, and cognitive architectures for the bots. Routines can be run by users, bots, or a combination of both, enabling seamless collaboration. [Check out our current routines here](https://vrooli.com/search?type="Routine").
- **Recursive Self-Improvement:** Bots utilize cognitive routines to continually build and enhance various components on the site — including other cognitive routines — enabling recursive self-improvement. Recursive self-improvement refers to the process where bots iteratively enhance their own capabilities. One of our goals is to build a team of bots that automatically suggests improvements to the most popular routines on the platform. [Learn more about recursive self-improvement here](#-recursive-self-improvement).

## 🤔 Why use Vrooli?
Vrooli is your ultimate tool for staying organized and achieving both personal and professional goals. Here's what sets it apart from other solutions:

- **Shared and Evolving Routines:** Routines can be shared and improved by anyone. They can be combined to create new, more sophisticated routines, promoting a collaborative ecosystem.
- **Polymorphic Output:** The output of a routine varies significantly based on the bot executing it. For instance, an Edgar Allan Poe bot would approach a "Write a Novel" routine differently than an Isaac Asimov bot. Polymorphic in this context means that routines can produce different outputs based on the bot's unique personality, as well as their role and the team they are part of.
- **Accessible Business Processes:** Anyone can copy a public team, granting access to refined business processes and on-demand employees for various purposes, all at no additional cost.
- **Standards for Structure:** Create standards to define prompts, allowing for the quick structuring of chat messages to bots.
- **Integrated Communication:** Engage with multiple bots and humans in the same conversation, facilitating seamless collaboration to complete tasks.
- **Scheduled Automation:** Routines can be scheduled to run at specific times or when certain conditions are met, ensuring timely and automated task completion.

## 🔑 Core Capabilities
Learn more about our key features and how they work together:

### Autonomous Agents
Vrooli allows you to create bots, known as autonomous agents, that perform tasks without constant human supervision. These agents can interact with users through chat and execute various functions, such as scheduling tasks, summarizing meetings, and generating marketing reports. This enables a seamless automation experience, providing reliable support around the clock.

### Recursive Self-Improvement
At the heart of Vrooli is the concept of recursive self-improvement. Bots utilize cognitive routines to continuously enhance their own capabilities and those of the platform. This iterative process ensures that Vrooli evolves and becomes more efficient over time, learning from each interaction and task completion to better serve user needs.

### Polymorphic Routines
Vrooli's routines are polymorphic, meaning they can adapt and produce varied outputs based on the executing agent's unique personality and role. For example, a routine designed to analyze financial data will generate different insights when run by a Warren Buffett bot compared to an Elon Musk bot. This flexibility allows for a more personalized and dynamic approach to automation.

### Dynamic Team Building
Users can create and manage dynamic teams consisting of both bots and humans, with each member assigned specific roles. These teams foster collaboration towards common goals such as developing new products, conducting market research, or managing social media campaigns. The ability to add or remove bots at any time provides the flexibility to adapt to changing project requirements in a way that traditional organizations cannot.

### Powerful and Reusable Routines
Tasks are accomplished through routines — reusable building blocks that integrate standards, APIs, code, smart contracts, and other native components. These routines can be customized for any purpose, whether for internal business processes, tutorials, onboarding forms, personal guides, or cognitive architectures for bots. By leveraging routines, users can streamline complex workflows and achieve consistent results.

### Shared and Evolving Ecosystem
Vrooli promotes a collaborative ecosystem where routines can be shared, improved, and combined to create new, sophisticated routines. This shared knowledge base accelerates the development of innovative solutions and enhances the overall capabilities of the platform. It also reduces the learning curve and setup time for new users, enabling them to leverage existing routines to achieve their goals more efficiently.

### Accessible and Integrated Communication
Engage with multiple bots and humans in the same conversation, enabling integrated communication and seamless collaboration. This ensures that tasks are completed efficiently and that all team members, whether human or bot, are on the same page.

### Scheduled and Conditional Automation
Routines can be scheduled to run at specific times or triggered by certain conditions. This feature ensures timely and automated task completion, allowing users to focus on more strategic activities.

Vrooli's unique features make it a powerful tool for automating workflows and enhancing productivity. Whether you're managing a business, conducting research, or working on creative projects, Vrooli provides the capabilities to automate, improve, and innovate continuously.

## 🔄 Recursive Self-Improvement
Recursive self-improvement is at the core of Vrooli's potential to revolutionize meaningful work, enabling both bots and humans to iteratively enhance their workflows and efficiencies. Here's how it works:

- **Step 1:** Bots and humans create routines. These routines are sequences of tasks that can be reused and combined in various ways. Time, cost, and complexity metrics for each routine and their subroutines are tracked.
- **Step 2:** Bots and humans analyze these metrics to improve the efficiency of routines and other components like standards, teams, and projects. By identifying the least efficient or least automated areas, they can prioritize these for enhancement. Improvements can be crowdsourced using Vrooli profits or donations.
- **Step 3:** The same improvement process can be applied to the routines and components used in Step 2. This means bots and humans are constantly refining the tools they use to improve other routines.
- **Step k:** This process is repeated as many times as necessary, continually improving the routines that enhance other routines. This creates a meta-improvement loop, where the system becomes more efficient over time.

## 🤝 Join the Team
Vrooli's vision is bright, but a lot of work needs to be done to get there. I would love to receive help for this project, but there are some things you need to know...

While this project aims for profitability, Vrooli is not structured as a traditional business. I'm just a developer with a vision; I don't want to manage employees, and I don't want to be obligated to respond to comments on a regular basis. Collaborators are welcome to suggest and complete tasks on [our project board](https://github.com/orgs/Vrooli/projects/1). Once we become profitable, I will add bounty rewards to tasks that are completed.

If you'd like to play a larger role in the development of this project, the following skills are welcome:
- **CEO/COO** - I'm looking for someone to help me manage the business side of things. This includes marketing, legal, and other business-related tasks. I'm also looking for someone to manage the community, and to help me make decisions on the direction of the project.
- **Kubernetes** - This project needs a Kubernetes cluster to scale. Some work has been completed to prepare for this, but there's still lots to go. I'm also looking for someone to help me setup a CI/CD pipeline.
- **API developers** - Calling APIs is a core feature of Vrooli. I'm leaning towards using [Chainlink's Any API](https://docs.chain.link/any-api/introduction/) to accomplish this, but I'm open to other solutions. Anyone who can help set this up will be greatly appreciated.
- **Crypto bros** - Utilizing smart contracts will be important in the future for decentralizing the platform. This will be required to automate governments.

Note that as AI and this project advances, these roles will start to become obsolete. We are trying to bring about a jobless future, after all😊

If you'd like to work with me on this project, or want to contact me for another reason, [here are my links](https://matthalloran.info).

# 📜 License
Vrooli is released under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)][license]. This license enhances the GPLv3 to address use of software over a network, and it allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute the software, provided that any derivative works or versions used over a network are also shared under the same license.

## Why AGPL 3.0?
We chose the AGPL 3.0 license for several key reasons:

- **Network Use Transparency:** The AGPL 3.0 extends the GPLv3 by requiring that modifications made and deployed over a network are made available to the public. This ensures transparency and collaborative improvement even when the software is used as a network service.
- **Freedom and Collaboration:** AGPL 3.0 promotes freedom and collaboration, aligning with Vrooli's mission to create an open and shared ecosystem. It ensures that the software remains free for all users and encourages a collaborative approach to development and improvement.
- **Security and Accountability:** By requiring that all network-deployed modifications be open source, the AGPL 3.0 enhances security and accountability. Users can review, audit, and contribute to the code, fostering a trustworthy and secure platform.
- **Community Growth:** The AGPL 3.0 encourages community growth and innovation. Developers can build upon Vrooli, creating new features and improvements that benefit the entire community.
- **Preventing Proprietary Lock-in:** The AGPL 3.0 helps prevent proprietary lock-in of the software, ensuring that improvements and innovations remain accessible to everyone, especially in network-based deployments.

By choosing the AGPL 3.0, we are committed to maintaining an open, collaborative, and secure environment for all Vrooli users and contributors, regardless of how the platform is deployed or accessed.
