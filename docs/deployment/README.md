## Deployment Options

Vrooli can be deployed in several configurations depending on your needs:

### [Single Server Deployment](./single_server.md)
Deploy all Vrooli components on a single server for simpler setups or development environments. This is the recommended approach for getting started.

### [Multiple Servers Deployment](./multiple_servers.md)
For production environments with higher traffic, you can distribute Vrooli components across multiple servers for improved performance and scalability.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### [CI/CD Setup](./ci_cd_setup.md)
Detailed instructions for setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipeline to automate testing and deployment processes. This document covers:

- GitHub Actions workflow configuration
- Development VPS setup and configuration
- Automated testing and deployment
- Environment-specific deployment scripts
- Monitoring and notifications

## Secrets Management

### [Secrets Management](./secrets_management.md)
Best practices and instructions for managing sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and other secrets securely across development and production environments.

## Kubernetes Deployment

### [Kubernetes Setup and Testing](./kubernetes_testing.md)
Comprehensive guide for deploying Vrooli on Kubernetes, including testing procedures, scaling considerations, and best practices for container orchestration.

## Environment Setup

### [Development Environment](./development_environment.md)
Setting up an isolated development environment that mirrors the production configuration for testing changes before deployment.

### [Production Environment](./production_environment.md)
Guidelines for configuring and securing a production environment, including performance optimization, monitoring, and backup strategies.

## Best Practices

- Always use version control for configuration files
- Implement staging environments for testing before production deployment
- Use the VSCode Peacock extension (or similar tool) to visually distinguish between development and production environments
- Regularly test your deployment and backup/restore procedures
- Document environment-specific settings for each deployment

## Troubleshooting

For common deployment issues and their solutions, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](./troubleshooting.md).
