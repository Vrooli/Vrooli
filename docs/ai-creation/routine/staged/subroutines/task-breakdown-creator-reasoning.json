Decompose projects into manageable phases and tasks using systematic work breakdown structure principles.\n\nProject Scope:\n{{input.projectScope}}\n\nKey Deliverables:\n{{input.keyDeliverables}}\n\nProject Timeline:\n{{input.projectTimeline}}\n\nCreate comprehensive task breakdown structure:\n\n1. **Project Phase Structure**:\n   Organize work into logical phases:\n   - **Initiation Phase**: Project setup, planning, and resource allocation\n   - **Planning Phase**: Detailed design, requirements gathering, and preparation\n   - **Execution Phase**: Core implementation and development work\n   - **Testing Phase**: Validation, quality assurance, and refinement\n   - **Deployment Phase**: Rollout, training, and go-live activities\n   - **Closure Phase**: Documentation, review, and project wrap-up\n\n2. **Work Breakdown Structure**:\n   Decompose each phase into specific tasks:\n   - **Level 1 Tasks**: Major work packages within each phase\n   - **Level 2 Tasks**: Detailed activities that comprise major work packages\n   - **Level 3 Tasks**: Granular tasks that can be assigned to individuals\n   - **Task Sizing**: Ensure tasks are appropriately sized (not too large or small)\n   - **Task Clarity**: Each task has clear, actionable objectives\n   - **Completeness**: All necessary work is captured in the breakdown\n\n3. **Task Categorization**:\n   Classify tasks by type and characteristics:\n   - **Critical Path Tasks**: Activities that directly impact project completion time\n   - **Parallel Tasks**: Work that can be done simultaneously with other activities\n   - **Dependent Tasks**: Activities that require completion of prerequisite work\n   - **Resource-Intensive Tasks**: Activities requiring significant time, people, or budget\n   - **Risk-Heavy Tasks**: Activities with high uncertainty or potential complications\n   - **Quick Wins**: Tasks that deliver value early in the project timeline\n\n4. **Task Specifications**:\n   Define detailed requirements for each task:\n   - **Task Objectives**: What the task aims to accomplish\n   - **Acceptance Criteria**: How to determine when the task is complete\n   - **Resource Requirements**: People, tools, or materials needed\n   - **Skill Requirements**: Capabilities needed to execute the task\n   - **Estimated Duration**: Time needed for completion\n   - **Complexity Level**: Difficulty rating to aid in resource allocation\n\n5. **Phase Integration**:\n   Ensure phases work together cohesively:\n   - **Phase Dependencies**: How phases build upon each other\n   - **Handoff Points**: Transition activities between phases\n   - **Phase Gates**: Decision points and approval processes\n   - **Deliverable Flow**: How outputs from one phase feed into the next\n   - **Quality Checkpoints**: Review and validation activities\n   - **Risk Mitigation**: How phases address project risks\n\n6. **Task Counting and Sizing**:\n   Provide quantitative breakdown metrics:\n   - **Total Task Count**: Overall number of tasks in the project\n   - **Tasks per Phase**: Distribution of work across phases\n   - **Task Complexity Distribution**: Mix of simple, moderate, and complex tasks\n   - **Estimated Total Effort**: Aggregate time requirements\n   - **Resource Loading**: Distribution of resource requirements\n   - **Critical Path Length**: Time required for longest task sequence\n\nProvide output as JSON with:\n- workBreakdown: Hierarchical task structure organized by phases\n- phaseStructure: Detailed phase definitions and organization\n- totalTasks: Quantitative summary of task count and distribution",
