### 📋 Routines
**Routines** are the heart of Vrooli - reusable workflows that automate tasks. Think of them as intelligent recipes that can:
- Execute step-by-step processes
- Make decisions based on conditions
- Integrate with external services
- Evolve and improve over time

### 🤖 Agents
**Agents** are AI-powered assistants that execute tasks within routines. They can:
- Understand natural language
- Process data and make decisions
- Learn from experience
- Collaborate with other agents

### 👥 Teams
**Teams** allow multiple users to collaborate on projects, sharing:
- Routines and workflows
- Agent configurations
- Resources and data
- Permissions and access

### 🌊 Swarms
**Swarms** are coordinated groups of agents working together on complex tasks, featuring:
- Distributed problem-solving
- Parallel execution
- Emergent intelligence
- Self-organization

## 🏗️ How Vrooli Works

Vrooli operates on a three-tier intelligence architecture:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as You
    participant C as Coordinator (Tier 1)
    participant P as Process Manager (Tier 2)
    participant E as Executor (Tier 3)
    participant R as Results
    
    U->>C: Request Task
    Note over C: Analyzes request<br/>Plans strategy
    C->>P: Delegate to Process
    Note over P: Breaks down task<br/>Assigns to agents
    P->>E: Execute Steps
    Note over E: Performs actions<br/>Gathers data
    E->>R: Generate Output
    R->>P: Return Results
    P->>C: Compile Response
    C->>U: Deliver Solution
    
    Note over C,E: Continuous Learning & Improvement
```

### The Three Tiers Explained

1. **🧠 Tier 1 - Coordination Intelligence**
   - Strategic planning and resource allocation
   - High-level decision making
   - Swarm orchestration

2. **🔄 Tier 2 - Process Intelligence**
   - Task decomposition and routing
   - Workflow management
   - Progress monitoring

3. **⚡ Tier 3 - Execution Intelligence**
   - Direct task execution
   - Tool integration
   - Data processing
