- Search strategies are efficient and effective
- Workspace layout supports productivity goals

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### **Challenge**: "I don't know how to organize my projects"
**Solution**: Provide organization templates. "Start with simple project categories like 'Personal,' 'Work,' and 'Learning.' You can always reorganize later."

### **Challenge**: "I have too much content to organize"
**Solution**: Suggest incremental organization. "Start by organizing new content as you create it. Gradually work through existing content during quiet periods."

### **Challenge**: "Search doesn't find what I'm looking for"
**Solution**: Teach search strategies. "Try different keywords, use filters to narrow results, and remember that AI can help interpret what you're looking for."

### **Challenge**: "The workspace feels cluttered"
**Solution**: Guide simplification. "Start with a minimal layout and add elements only as you need them. Less can be more for productivity."
