# Interactive Tutorial

A comprehensive 10-section tutorial system for learning Vrooli's AI-powered productivity platform through hands-on experience.

## Overview

This tutorial is designed around Vrooli's chat-first, AI agent swarm architecture. Users learn to interact with AI agents through natural conversation rather than traditional web interface navigation.

## Philosophy

**From Interface Learning to AI Capability Discovery**

- **Chat-Native**: All interactions happen within or adjacent to chat interfaces
- **AI-First**: Focus on what AI can accomplish for users, not manual processes
- **Natural Language Priority**: Encourage conversational interaction over menu navigation
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, reveal complexity as users become proficient
- **Real Examples**: Live AI demonstrations rather than static explanations

## Tutorial Structure

### **Essential Path** (New Users - 20-30 minutes)
