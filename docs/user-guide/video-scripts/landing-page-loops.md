# Landing Page Video Loop Prompts

These prompts are designed for AI video generation tools (Veo 3, Sora, etc.) to create compelling loops for the Vrooli landing page.

## Slide 2: "Build Anything Without Writing Code"

### Primary Concept: Idea to Reality Transformation

**Prompt:**
Create a dynamic visualization showing ideas transforming into fully realized digital products. Start with a glowing text input field floating in dark space where words appear: "fitness tracking app".

Animation sequence:
1. Text transforms into glowing particles that scatter and reorganize
2. Particles form into UI wireframes, code snippets, design elements
3. Multiple AI nodes (hexagonal shapes) swarm around the elements
4. Each node tackles different aspects - some create interfaces, others write code
5. Watch as a complete app materializes: screens, features, backend systems
6. Transition to new idea: "data analytics dashboard"
7. Same process but faster, showing different output types
8. End with array of created products orbiting the input field

Visual style: Dark background with holographic UI elements. Tron-like aesthetic. Floating code snippets and design elements. Particle effects for transformations.
Audio: Typing sounds, digital construction noises, triumphant completion chimes.
Duration: 20-second seamless loop

## Slide 3: "Work That Gets Better While You Sleep"

### Primary Concept: Routine Evolution Timeline

**Prompt:**
Create a split-screen visualization showing the same complex task being executed in two different ways, with a futuristic holographic interface aesthetic.

Left side labeled "Day 1":
- Show a flowchart with 15+ nodes connected by winding paths
- Execution visualized as a glowing orb slowly traversing each step
- Digital clock showing 5:27 counting down
- Credit counter showing 450 and decreasing
- Red/orange color scheme indicating inefficiency

Right side labeled "Day 30":
- Same task but with only 3-4 elegant nodes
- Execution races through as lightning-fast light streams
- Clock shows 0:45 and counting
- Credit counter shows 75
- Green/blue color scheme indicating optimization

Center divider:
- DNA helix or evolution-inspired transition effect
- Particles flowing from left to right, transforming from red to green

Visual style: Holographic UI elements on dark background. Tron-like aesthetic with glowing edges. Data visualization overlays showing metrics.
Audio: Slow mechanical sounds on left transitioning to swift, efficient electronic sounds on right.
Duration: 15-second seamless loop

## Slide 4: "Your AI Company, Running at Light Speed"

### Primary Concept: Three-Tier Orchestra

**Prompt:**
Visualize a futuristic command center with three distinct levels, like a transparent glass skyscraper viewed from the side. Each level represents a tier of AI intelligence.

Top level (Strategic/Executive):
- 3-5 large, slowly pulsing nodes with golden light
- Making high-level decisions shown as emanating ripples
- Thoughtful, measured movements

Middle level (Management/Orchestration):
- 10-15 medium nodes with blue light
- Rapidly coordinating and distributing tasks
- Visible connections up to executives and down to workers
- Flow charts and diagrams materializing and dissolving

Bottom level (Execution/Workers):
- 50+ small nodes with green/white light
- Intense activity, rapid task completion
- Swarms forming and reforming based on assignments

Dynamic elements:
- Information flows upward as glowing particles (reports/insights)
- Decisions flow downward as structured light beams
- When a challenge appears (geometric puzzle), watch the entire structure reorganize
- Temporary specialist teams form with connecting bridges
- Upon completion, structure returns to base state

Visual style: Glass and light aesthetic, like a living building. Depth and parallax effects. Particle systems for data flow. 
Audio: Layered electronic symphony - deep bass for executives, mid-range for managers, high frequencies for workers.
Duration: 25-second seamless loop

## Production Guidelines

1. **Color Palette**: Consistent across all videos
   - Primary: Cyan (#00FFFF), Magenta (#FF00FF)
   - Secondary: Emerald (#50C878), Gold (#FFD700)
   - Background: Deep blue-black (#0A0A0F)
   - Accents: Neon blue, electric purple

2. **Technical Specifications**:
   - Resolution: 1920x1080 minimum (4K preferred)
   - Format: WebM or MP4 with H.265 encoding
   - File size: Optimize for web (target < 5MB per loop)
   - Frame rate: 30fps or 60fps for smooth motion
   - Seamless loop: First and last frames must be identical

3. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Ensure key visual elements are visible in center 60% of frame
   - Avoid tiny details that won't be visible on phones
   - Test loops at various sizes before finalizing

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Avoid rapid flashing or strobing effects
   - Maintain sufficient contrast for visibility
   - Design to work without audio (audio enhances but isn't required)

5. **Brand Consistency**:
   - Match the futuristic, sophisticated aesthetic of Vrooli
   - Convey innovation, intelligence, and empowerment
   - Feel premium but approachable

## Alternative Concepts

### Backup for Slide 2: "Natural Language to Creation"
Show a chat interface where someone types natural language requests. As they type, the words transform into actual creations - "I need a website" becomes a live site, "analyze my sales data" spawns charts and insights. Emphasize the conversational nature.

### Backup for Slide 3: "Building Block Assembly"  
Visualize routines as glowing LEGO-like blocks that combine to create increasingly sophisticated structures. Show simple blocks joining to form complex, beautiful crystalline structures that continue evolving.

### Backup for Slide 4: "Adaptive Swarm Formation"
Show geometric challenges appearing. AI nodes dynamically swarm and reorganize to match each challenge's shape. Beautiful choreographed movements as they solve and dissolve.
