# Routine/Swarm Video Script

**Duration**: 45-60 seconds  
**Target Audience**: Users interested in automation and workflow building  
**LandingView Integration**: Corresponds to `videoUrls.Routine` on routines slide  
**Thumbnail**: Graphical representation of routine nodes and connections

## Video Overview

This video demonstrates Vrooli's automation power through rapid routine creation and swarm execution, showing how complex workflows are built and coordinated automatically.

## Key Messages

1. **Instant Automation**: "Describe workflows - AI builds them automatically"
2. **Swarm Coordination**: "Multiple agents execute complex routines seamlessly"
3. **Visual Control**: "See and adjust workflows with drag-and-drop simplicity"

## Scene Breakdown

### **Rapid Automation Demo** (0:00-60 seconds)

**Opening** (0:00-0:12)
**Visual**: Split screen - manual workflow vs. automated
**Script**: *"This manager's weekly planning took 4 hours. Watch it become fully automated:"*

**Conversational Creation** (0:12-0:25)
```
User: "Automate my weekly team planning - gather updates, analyze blockers, send summary to executives"

Valyxa: "Building your planning routine now..."
```
**Visual**: Chat transforms into visual workflow with connecting nodes

**Fast-Forward Building** (0:25-0:40)
**Visual**: Time-lapse of visual routine builder with nodes connecting
**Script**: *"Visual builder creates the workflow automatically..."*
**On-screen**: "FAST-FORWARD: ROUTINE BUILT IN 15 SECONDS"
- Data collection nodes appear
- Analysis connections form
- Output delivery points connect

**Swarm Execution** (0:40-0:55)
**Visual**: Multiple agents coordinating with progress indicators
**Script**: *"AI swarms execute automatically - 12 agents working together:"*
- Tier 1: Strategic coordination
- Tier 2: Process management  
- Tier 3: Direct execution
**On-screen**: "LIVE EXECUTION: 18 MINUTES COMPRESSED"

**Results** (0:55-0:60)
**Visual**: Executive summary report generated
**Script**: *"4 hours of manual work now happens automatically every week."*
