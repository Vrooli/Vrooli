[Three weeks later]

User: I need to create pricing for our new product line

Valyxa: 💡 I remember your comprehensive competitor analysis from October! Based on that research, I have specific insights that could inform your pricing strategy:

**Key Findings from Previous Analysis:**
- Market positioning opportunities identified between Competitor A ($15-25 range) and Competitor B ($35-45 premium tier)
- Price sensitivity data showed 67% acceptance rate at $28-32 price point
- Feature differentiation opportunities in sustainability messaging

**Recommendation:** Position 15% above Competitor A but below Competitor B's premium tier, around $29-31, leveraging your sustainability advantages identified in the analysis.

Should I create a detailed pricing strategy that builds on those competitive insights? I can also factor in any market changes since October.
