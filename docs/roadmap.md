- Implement image generation and editing
- Support direct computer control for advanced automation

## Future Challenges and Strategies

### Technical Challenges:

1. **Scalability**: As user base grows, ensuring the platform remains responsive and reliable
   - Strategy: Implement horizontal scaling, caching improvements, and database sharding
   - Timeline: Ongoing with significant improvements at T+52 weeks

2. **Security and Privacy**: Protecting user data and ensuring secure agent operations
   - Strategy: Regular security audits, encryption at rest and in transit, and fine-grained access controls
   - Timeline: Continuous with comprehensive review at T+36 weeks

3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Navigating emerging AI regulations and data privacy laws
   - Strategy: Establish compliance team, maintain documentation, implement configurable data retention
   - Timeline: Initial framework at T+24 weeks, ongoing monitoring and updates

### Organizational Challenges:

1. **Community Building**: Creating an active and engaged user community
   - Strategy: Develop comprehensive documentation, create tutorials, host events
   - Timeline: Beginning immediately after Version 2 launch at T+12 weeks

2. **Feedback Integration**: Effectively incorporating user feedback into development
   - Strategy: Implement structured feedback channels and prioritization framework
   - Timeline: T+12 to T+16 weeks following Version 2 launch

## Conclusion

The Vrooli roadmap outlines an ambitious but achievable path from its current state to a fully functional platform that democratizes access to powerful AI-driven automation. By prioritizing the UX refresh, chat functionality, and routines implementation for the Version 2 launch, we establish a solid foundation upon which to build more advanced features.

The phased approach allows for iterative improvement based on user feedback while maintaining a clear vision for the platform's long-term potential. This balanced approach addresses both immediate needs and future aspirations, positioning Vrooli as a leading platform for accessible AI automation.
