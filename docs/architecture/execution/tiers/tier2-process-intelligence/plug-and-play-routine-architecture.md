## **Plug-and-Play Routine Architecture**
The RunStateMachine represents Vrooli's core innovation: a **universal routine execution engine** that's completely agnostic to the underlying automation platform. This creates an unprecedented **universal automation ecosystem**:

- **BPMN 2.0** support out of the box for enterprise-grade process modeling
- Designed for **interoperability** with other workflow standards:
  - [Langchain](https://langchain.com/) graphs and chains
  - [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) workflows
  - [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) DAGs
  - [n8n](https://n8n.io/) workflows
  - Future support for any graph-based automation standard

This means swarms from different platforms can share and execute each other's routines, creating a **universal automation ecosystem** where the best automation workflows can be used anywhere, regardless of their original platform.
