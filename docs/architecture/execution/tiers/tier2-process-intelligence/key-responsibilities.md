## **Key Responsibilities**

- **Universal Execution**: Execute routines from any supported platform using the same engine
- **Recursive Composition**: Support unlimited nesting of multi-step and single-step routines  
- **Context Management**: Maintain hierarchical execution contexts with proper data flow
- **Sensitivity Handling**: Enforce data sensitivity rules throughout execution
- **Parallel Coordination**: Manage complex branching and synchronization across routine types
- **State Management**: Maintain execution state with recovery and audit capabilities across platforms
- **Intelligent Navigation**: Optimize execution paths while preserving platform-specific semantics
- **Strategy Evolution**: Enable gradual transformation from conversational to deterministic execution
