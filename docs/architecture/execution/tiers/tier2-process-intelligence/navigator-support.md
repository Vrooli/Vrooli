## **Current & Planned Navigator Support**

**Currently Implemented**:
- **BPMN Navigator**: Full BPMN 2.0 support with gateways, events, and parallel execution

**Planned Navigators**:
- **Langchain Navigator**: Execute LangGraph chains and AI agent workflows
- **Temporal Navigator**: Support for durable execution and long-running workflows  
- **Apache Airflow Navigator**: Execute data pipeline DAGs and ETL workflows
- **n8n Navigator**: Support for low-code automation workflows
- **Custom Navigator**: Framework for domain-specific workflow standards

This architecture makes Vrooli the **universal execution layer** for automation - like how Kubernetes became the universal orchestration layer for containers, Vrooli becomes the universal orchestration layer for intelligent workflows.
