# AdvancedInput Focus Enhancement
Priority: MEDIUM  
Status: DONE
Dependencies: None
ParentTask: None

**Description:**  
Implement functionality to focus the markdown/lexical text input component when clicking anywhere on AdvancedInput that's not a button/chip or other interactive element. Previous attempts were unsuccessful, so careful implementation with debugging is required.

**Key Deliverables:**
- [x] Analyze previous implementation attempts and identify issues
- [x] Implement event handling for clicks on non-interactive areas
- [x] Add temporary logging for debugging and verification
- [x] Test focus behavior across different scenarios and components
- [x] Document the solution for future reference
