- **Implement Redis Connection Pool Management** - Create proper Redis connection pool with connection reuse, health checks, and automatic reconnection logic to improve resource utilization and reliability.

- **Implement Environment Variable Validation** - Create validation system for environment variables at startup with clear error messages for missing or invalid configurations based on .env-example file.

- **Research WebSocket Connection Pool Management** - Investigate current WebSocket implementation for real-time features. Research best practices for connection pooling, reconnection logic, and resource efficiency. Provide recommendation on whether improvements are needed.

- **Research Test Data Factory System** - Investigate current test fixture approach and research best practices for test data factories. Analyze builder patterns, factory libraries, and provide recommendation on implementation approach to replace scattered fixture files.
