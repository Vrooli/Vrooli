## 🔐 Security Principles

Vrooli's security is built on these core principles:

1. **Emergent Intelligence** - Security capabilities arise from AI agent swarms
2. **Event-Driven** - All security decisions flow through the event bus
3. **Adaptive Protection** - Security improves through continuous learning
4. **Domain-Specific** - Deploy agents tailored to your industry needs
5. **Collaborative Defense** - Agents work together for comprehensive protection
