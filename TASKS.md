# Vrooli Tasks

This file tracks tasks, features, and improvements for the Vrooli project. Tasks are organized by status and priority.

## ü§ñ AI Actions and Prompts

### 1. Organize Unstructured Tasks
Use this prompt to convert unstructured tasks into properly formatted entries:
```markdown
Given the unstructured tasks:
1. Analyze each task to determine:
   - A clear, concise title
   - Priority (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on impact and urgency
   - Status (TODO/IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED/DONE)
   - Appropriate section (Active Tasks or Backlog)
2. Break down tasks into clear deliverables
3. Format using the task template
4. Place in appropriate sections
5. Remove from unstructured section
6. If any task lacks critical information, ask for clarification
```

### 2. Reprioritize Tasks
Use this prompt to review and adjust task priorities:
```markdown
Review all tasks and:
1. Evaluate each task's priority based on:
   - Business impact (high/medium/low)
   - Technical urgency (high/medium/low)
   - Dependencies on other tasks
   - Current project goals
2. Adjust priority levels (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
3. Reorder tasks within sections based on new priorities
4. Provide brief justification for any priority changes
5. Move tasks between Active and Backlog if needed
```

### 3. Suggest New Tasks
Use this prompt to suggest new tasks based on existing ones:
```markdown
Analyze the current tasks and:
1. Identify potential gaps in:
   - Technical infrastructure
   - User experience
   - Documentation
   - Testing coverage
   - Security measures
2. Consider dependencies of existing tasks
3. Review industry best practices
4. Suggest new tasks that would:
   - Complement existing tasks
   - Address identified gaps
   - Improve project quality
5. Format suggestions using the task template
6. Add to unstructured section for review
```

### 4. Update Task Status
Use this prompt to review and update task status:
```markdown
For each task:
1. Review deliverables and completion criteria
2. Check for:
   - Completed deliverables
   - Blocked items
   - Dependencies
   - Progress indicators
3. Update status to reflect current state
4. Move between sections if needed
5. Add any new blockers or dependencies
6. Update deliverable checkboxes
```

### 5. Clean Up and Consolidate
Use this prompt to maintain task list clarity:
```markdown
Review all tasks and:
1. Identify and merge duplicate tasks
2. Break down overly large tasks
3. Remove or archive completed tasks
4. Update outdated information
5. Ensure consistent formatting
6. Add missing details to incomplete entries
7. Validate all task dependencies
```
