This file tracks and manages tasks, features, and improvements for the Vrooli project. Each task is designed for autonomous execution with clear deliverables and step-by-step instructions to ensure that if a task is picked using the "go" command, it can be completed with minimal clarification.

# Task Operations
**organize:**  
- Scan this file for unstructured tasks, extract key details (titles, priorities, statuses, deliverables), and reformat using the task template. If any task lacks critical information, flag it for clarification.

**reprioritize:**  
- Review all tasks and adjust priorities (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) based on business impact, technical urgency, dependencies, and current project goals. Provide brief justifications for changes, and reorder tasks accordingly.

**suggest:**  
- Identify gaps in technical infrastructure, user experience, documentation, testing, or security. Based on these gaps and dependencies, suggest new tasks formatted with the task template and add them for review.

**update:**  
- Review each task's deliverables and progress indicators, update the status (TODO/IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED/DONE), and reflect any new blockers or dependencies.

**cleanup:**  
- Merge duplicate tasks, split tasks that are too large, and archive completed items. Ensure all task entries have consistent formatting and sufficient detail.

**go:**  
- Select the highest-priority task from the backlog, prioritizing those related to recently completed work when appropriate to reduce context switching. First explore the codebase to identify possible implementation approaches, then draft a brief plan with options. After confirmation, automatically update the task status to IN_PROGRESS. When you think the task is completed, wait for confirmation before changing the task to DONE and moving it to the "Completed Tasks" section.

**engage:**  
- Prompt: "Would you like me to review and update our task list or start working on a backlog item?" and wait for input.
