# Progress — {{SCENARIO_DISPLAY_NAME}}

Lifecycle log for meaningful scenario changes. Future agents read this
file to understand what changed without reconstructing history from git.

This file ships empty in newly generated scenarios. Append entries when
work lands, not while work is still speculative.

## Progress Log

| Date | Author | Status | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-07-07 | codex | partial | Experience floors/component-canon Phase 5 slice: bumped template to 1.6.0, seeded generated scenarios with adopted-provenance UI primitives, reworked AppShell to min-h-dvh with fixed safe-area BottomNav and Settings-owned locale switching, converted starter dashboard/notes/settings surfaces to governed components, added DataTable sorting/searching for the notes example, and updated generated docs to steer adopt-not-hand-roll UI growth. Validation: shallow template validation and generator tests passed; deep quick validation still fails on broader pre-existing template gates, with the slice-specific scattered-keydown warning addressed and component coverage improved. |
