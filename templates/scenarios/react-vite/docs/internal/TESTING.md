# Testing — {{SCENARIO_DISPLAY_NAME}}

## Shared guidance

- [Test authoring standard](/docs/testing/UNIT-TEST-AUTHORING.md): boundaries,
  fixtures, and independently justified expectations.
- [Execution and validation scope](/docs/TESTING.md): focused checks and Test Genie.
- [Shared harness recipes](/scenarios/template-manager/docs/internal/TESTING-RECIPES.md): API, UI, CLI,
  cancellation, workflow replay, and coverage configuration.

The recipes describe template mechanics. This guide owns local behavior, test
prerequisites, fixtures, and exceptions; local test sources and configuration
identify the helpers and gates this scenario currently uses.

## Scenario-specific testing

Record the behaviors this scenario must prove, deterministic fixtures, required
external services, and any exceptions to the shared harness. Link to real local
tests as they are added. Keep execution receipts with their owning plan.

## Binary startup

`api/main_e2e_test.go` uses `api-core/boottest` to build this API, verify its
health identity in isolated storage, and check shutdown. Keep the expected
service name in the scenario test. Shared process machinery and failure
regressions live in `packages/api-core/boottest`; see its package README section
for configuration and evidence limits. The existing E2E gate runs this test.
