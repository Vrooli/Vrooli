# Seams — {{SCENARIO_DISPLAY_NAME}}

A **seam** is a deliberate boundary where production code calls an
interface, not a concrete dependency. The fake substitutes through that
interface in tests; production wires the real implementation in `main.go`.

This document is the authoritative list of seams in this scenario. Add
to it whenever you introduce a new interface that production wires once
and tests substitute. Remove from it only when the seam is genuinely
gone — not when "we don't fake it yet."

## Wire contracts live in proto, not seams

Before adding a new seam, ask: is this a *boundary* (a place where
production-vs-test substitution matters) or a *contract* (a payload
shape consumed by multiple processes)? Wire contracts belong in
`packages/proto/schemas/{{SCENARIO_ID}}/v1/<domain>/<file>.proto` —
NOT in interfaces. The generated Go + TypeScript types are the
canonical types every test, handler, and UI component reads from.

The `health` proto in `packages/proto/schemas/{{SCENARIO_ID}}/v1/health/`
is the worked example. The Go fixture (`api/internal/testutil/fixtures/health.go`)
re-exports the generated `Response` and provides functional-options
builders; the UI factory (`ui/src/test-utils/factories.ts`) builds
the same generated type via `create(ResponseSchema, ...)`. Drift
between the two is impossible because both consume one source of
truth.

If a piece of production code reaches for `time.Now()`, `*sql.DB`, or
the network without going through one of the entries below, that's a
new seam that hasn't been declared yet. Declaring it is the work — the
test ergonomics fall out for free.

## How to read this file

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Short name used to refer to the boundary in conversation. |
| **Interface** | Go file & symbol that defines the contract. |
| **Production wiring** | Where the real implementation is constructed. |
| **Test fake** | The fake under `internal/testutil/mocks/` that substitutes. |
| **Why it exists** | The class of bug it prevents or the test ergonomic it enables. |

## Current seams

### Clock

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Wall-clock time |
| **Interface** | `internal/clock/clock.go::Clock` (`Now() time.Time`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` constructs `clock.System{}` and passes it via `server.Deps`. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/testutil/mocks::FakeClock` (`Now`, `Advance`, `SetNow`). |
| **Why it exists** | Middleware computes request-duration log lines from two `Now()` calls. With `time.Now()` direct, duration assertions are flaky on loaded CI and undefined on fast hardware. With `FakeClock.Advance(150 * time.Millisecond)` inside the inner handler, the duration string is bit-for-bit deterministic. See `internal/middleware/logging_test.go::TestLoggingMiddleware_LogsDuration`. |

### Pinger (database reachability)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Database reachability probe |
| **Interface** | `internal/store/store.go::Pinger` (`PingContext(ctx) error`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.go` opens `*sql.DB` via `database.Connect(...)` against `modernc.org/sqlite` (pure-Go, CGO-clean). `*sql.DB` satisfies `Pinger` directly — no wrapper. |
| **Test fake** | `internal/testutil/mocks::FakePinger` (`PingErr error`, atomic `Calls` counter). |
| **Why it exists** | The `/health` handler probes the database. Without the seam, every handler test would either open the on-disk SQLite file (slow at scale, parallel-test contention) or skip the database branch entirely (untested degradation path). With `FakePinger{PingErr: errors.New("connection refused")}`, the unhealthy branch is one line. See `handlers/health/handler_test.go`. |

## Adding a new seam

The right time to add a seam is the moment you find yourself reaching
past `*sql.DB`, `http.Get`, or `os.OpenFile` from a handler/service. The
process is mechanical:

1. **Define the interface in a domain-named package.** Methods are
   exactly what callers need — no more, no less. Example:
   ```go
   // internal/store/store.go
   type TaskStore interface {
       CreateTask(ctx context.Context, t Task) (TaskID, error)
       GetTask(ctx context.Context, id TaskID) (Task, error)
   }
   ```
2. **Implement it in production with the concrete dependency wrapped
   in an unexported struct.** The struct holds `*sql.DB`; the methods
   translate domain calls to SQL. Production wires this in `main.go`;
   tests never see it.
3. **Add a fake in `internal/testutil/mocks/`.** Match the naming
   convention `Fake<Interface>` (e.g. `FakeTaskStore`). Each method
   takes a per-method error knob (`CreateTaskErr error`) plus any
   state it needs to return. Counters use `atomic.Int32`, not
   plain `int`, so race-detector tests don't flap.
4. **Update this document.** A row in the table above with the same
   five columns. If you skip this step, the seam exists but isn't
   discoverable — future readers will reinvent it parallel.
5. **Add a `var _` compile-time assertion** wherever the interface is
   defined: `var _ TaskStore = (*sqliteTaskStore)(nil)`. The assertion
   moves "this concrete type satisfies the interface" from a runtime
   surprise into a compile error.

## UI-side seams

The UI uses different mechanisms (Vitest's `vi.mock` hoisting), but
the goal is the same: production wires once, tests substitute.

### `lib/api` (network boundary)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | UI ↔ API HTTP boundary |
| **Module** | `ui/src/lib/api.ts` (`fetchHealth` and any future endpoint wrappers) |
| **Production wiring** | `App.tsx` (and any component using React Query) imports `fetchHealth` directly. |
| **Test fake** | Inline `vi.mock("./lib/api", async (importOriginal) => …)` at the top of each test file. The factory closure invokes `makeHealthResponse()` from `@/test-utils` to produce typed proto-shaped responses. |
| **Why it exists** | Network calls in unit tests would be flaky and slow. Mocking at this single module boundary means every component that reads `/health` gets the same substitution. The wrapper is intentionally thin (decode-only) so `vi.mock` doesn't have to reproduce business logic. |

### i18n singleton (locale state)

| | |
|---|---|
| **Seam** | Active locale + translation lookup |
| **Module** | `ui/src/i18n/index.ts` (`i18n`, `setLocale`, `getCurrentLocale`, `useTranslation`) |
| **Production wiring** | `main.tsx` imports the module, which initialises i18next as a process-wide singleton. Components consume via `useTranslation()`. |
| **Test fake** | `test-setup.ts` switches the singleton into `cimode` before every test (so `t('app.title')` returns the literal key `"app.title"`). Tests that need real-locale behaviour opt back in via `await setLocale("en")` in their own `beforeEach`. |
| **Why it exists** | Module-level singleton is intentional — i18next's React integration assumes one instance per renderer. The seam is the *configuration* (what locale is active), not the *interface*. cimode + the typed `strings.*` registry let tests assert on key paths instead of brittle copy. |

## What is NOT a seam

- **Pure-function helpers** (`internal/i18n/format.go`). They have no
  dependencies; tests call them directly. No interface required.
- **Standard-library types you don't control** (`time.Duration`, `url.URL`).
  The cost of a seam is overhead unless you'd otherwise be tempted to
  reach for global state.
- **Configuration structs** read once at startup. The seam is the
  *consumer* of the config, not the loader.
- **Generated proto types.** They're contracts, not seams. See "Wire
  contracts live in proto, not seams" above.
