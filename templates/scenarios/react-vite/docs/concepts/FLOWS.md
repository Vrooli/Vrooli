# Flows — {{SCENARIO_DISPLAY_NAME}}

This document is the canonical workflow and state-transition map for
the scenario. Use it when behavior depends on ordered states, retries,
cancellation, stale completion, background jobs, polling, or mutually
exclusive UI modes.

## Purpose Of This Document

Use this document to answer:

- Which user/system workflows matter?
- Which workflows have explicit states and events?
- Which transitions are illegal?
- Which tests prove workflow correctness?
- Which flows are known but not modeled yet?

Plain CRUD with no meaningful ordering constraints does not need a
workflow model.

## Flow Inventory

| Flow | Domain | Trigger | Outcome | Statefulness | Validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Attachment upload | notes | User/CLI uploads a file for a note. | Blob is stored and metadata is persisted. | Stateful upload request with validation and failure paths. | Handler/service tests and upload workflow tests. |

## Flow Details

### Attachment upload

- Owner domain: notes.
- Trigger: multipart upload request from UI or CLI.
- Inputs: note id, file key/name, file bytes, content type, file size.
- Steps:
  1. Parse multipart request.
  2. Validate note id and file metadata.
  3. Store opaque bytes through BlobStore.
  4. Persist attachment metadata through notes repository seam.
  5. Return proto-typed metadata response.
- Outputs: uploaded attachment metadata or typed error response.
- Failure modes: missing note id, missing file, invalid metadata, blob
  write failure, metadata persistence failure.
- Retry/cancel behavior: caller may retry after transport/storage
  failure; duplicate handling belongs to the owning real domain when
  product requirements demand it.
- Tests: `api/handlers/notes/attachments_handler_test.go`,
  `api/internal/notes/attachments_service_test.go`,
  `ui/src/features/notes/AttachmentUpload.test.tsx`.
- Requirements: template starter only.

## State Machines

| Domain/Flow | States | Illegal Transitions | Enforcement |
|---|---|---|---|
| notes / attachment upload | pending, uploading, success, error | success/error before upload starts; duplicate submit while uploading | UI workflow tests and handler/service validation |

## Maturity Ladder

Temporal workflows mature in layers. Do not skip the executable layers
to add a standalone formal document.

| Level | Name | What exists |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Unmodeled risk | Lifecycle behavior exists only inside handlers, components, callbacks, or jobs. |
| 1 | Inventory | The flow is listed here with owner, source links, risk, and next step. |
| 2 | Workflow model | State/status values, event values, `Transition`, and `CheckInvariants` live beside the owning domain or feature. |
| 3 | Matrix + traces | Tests cover every state/event pair and replay representative traces against production transition logic. |
| 4 | Declarative spec | A domain-local `*.spec.json` declares states, events, transitions, invariants, traces, and formal-model status. |
| 5 | Checked formal model | Quint/TLA+ or an equivalent tool checks the model and generates deterministic artifacts replayed by production tests. |

## Production Shape

API domains that own durable lifecycle state use:

```text
api/internal/<domain>/
  <flow>_workflow.go
  <flow>_workflow.spec.json
  <flow>_workflow_test.go
```

UI features that own client-side modes use:

```text
ui/src/features/<domain>/
  <domain>Workflow.ts
  <domain>Workflow.spec.json
  <domain>Workflow.test.ts
```

The workflow owns state/status values, events, `Transition`, and
`CheckInvariants`. It should be pure or nearly pure. Effects live
outside the workflow behind seams: repositories, BlobStore, clocks,
timers, HTTP clients, or UI API modules.

## Deferred / Unmodeled Flows

| Flow | Risk | Next Step |
|---|---|---|
| None yet. | Generated scaffold. | Add real scenario workflows when domains have stateful behavior. |
