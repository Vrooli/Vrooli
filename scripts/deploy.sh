# NOTE 2: First run build.sh on development server
# NOTE 3: If docker-compose file was changed since the last build, you should prune the containers and images before running this script.
# Finishes up the deployment process, which was started by build.sh:
# 1. Checks if Nginx containers are running
# 2. Copies current database and build to a safe location, under a temporary directory.
# 3. Runs git fetch and git pull to get the latest changes.
# 4. Runs setup.sh
# 5. Moves build created by build.sh to the correct location.
# 6. Restarts docker containers
