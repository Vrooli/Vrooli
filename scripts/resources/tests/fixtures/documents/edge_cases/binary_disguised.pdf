This file has a PDF extension but contains plain text instead of PDF binary data.
It should trigger format validation errors in document processing systems.

Some systems might try to process this as a PDF and fail gracefully.
Others might detect the format mismatch and report an error.

This type of file tests:
- Format validation capabilities
- Error handling for misnamed files
- Content-type detection vs. extension-based detection

The content is intentionally simple text to make the format mismatch obvious.
