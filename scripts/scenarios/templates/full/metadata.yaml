# Scenario metadata - Machine-readable configuration for both deployment and AI generation
# This template supports BOTH deployment orchestration AND AI generation patterns

scenario:
  # For manual creation, edit these directly
  # For AI generation, use: SCENARIO_ID_PLACEHOLDER, SCENARIO_NAME_PLACEHOLDER, SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION_PLACEHOLDER
  id: "scenario-name-here"                    # AI: Replace with kebab-case identifier (e.g., "customer-service-ai")
  name: "Human Readable Scenario Name"        # AI: Replace with business-friendly name (e.g., "Enterprise Customer Service AI")
  description: "Brief description of what this scenario tests and demonstrates"  # AI: One sentence problem + solution

categories:
  # AI Guidance: Choose categories that match business use case
  - primary-category     # AI: Choose from ai-assistance, ai-content-creation, automation, real-time-monitoring, etc.
  - secondary-category   # AI: Optional secondary categorization

# AI Guidance: Choose complexity based on resource count and integration complexity
# basic: 1-2 resources, simple integration
# intermediate: 3-4 resources, moderate integration  
# advanced: 5+ resources, complex orchestration
complexity: "intermediate"  # basic, intermediate, advanced
