# Scenario requirement registry template
# Replace placeholder entries with real requirements that map PRD items to
# automated validation. Each requirement should identify the validation assets
# (tests, workflows, automations) responsible for proving the behavior.
#
# 👉 Prefer the modular `requirements/` registry generated by
#    `vrooli scenario requirements init <name>`. This legacy single-file
#    template remains for backwards compatibility and lightweight scenarios.
